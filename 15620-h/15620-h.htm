PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="indent">
All sciences are making an advance, but Astronomy is moving at the
double-quick. Since the principles of this science were settled
by Copernicus, four hundred years ago, it has never had to beat
a retreat. It is rewritten not to correct material errors, but
to incorporate new discoveries.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Once Astronomy treated mostly of tides, seasons, and telescopic
aspects of the planets; now these are only primary matters. Once
it considered stars as mere fixed points of light; now it studies
them as suns, determines their age, size, color, movements, chemical
constitution, and the revolution of their planets. Once it considered
space as empty; now it knows that every cubic inch of it quivers with
greater intensity of force than that which is visible in Niagara.
Every inch of surface that can be conceived of between suns is more
wave-tossed than the ocean in a storm.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The invention of the telescope constituted one era in Astronomy;
its perfection in our day, another; and the discoveries of the
spectroscope a third&mdash;no less important than either of the
others.
</p>

<p class="indent">
While nearly all men are prevented from practical experimentation
in these high realms of knowledge, few
<a name="page viii"><span class="page">Page viii</span></a>
have so little leisure as to be debarred from intelligently enjoying
the results of the investigations of others.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This book has been written not only to reveal some of the highest
achievements of the human mind, but also to let the heavens declare
the glory of the Divine Mind. In the author's judgment, there is no
gulf that separates science and religion, nor any conflict where
they stand together. And it is fervently hoped that anyone who
comes to a better knowledge of God's works through reading this
book, may thereby come to a more intimate knowledge of the Worker.
</p>

<p class="indent">
I take great pleasure in acknowledging my indebtedness to J. M.
Van Vleck, LL.D., of the U.S. Nautical Almanac staff, and Professor
of Astronomy at the Wesleyan University, for inspecting some of the
more important chapters; to Dr. S. S. White, of Philadelphia, for
telescopic advantages; to Professor Henry Draper, for furnishing,
in advance of publication, a photograph of the sun's corona in 1878;
and to the excellent work on "Popular Astronomy," by Professor
Simon Newcomb, LL.D., Professor U. S. Naval Observatory, for some
of the most recent information, and for the use of the unequalled
engravings of Jupiter, Saturn, and the great nebula of Orion.

<i>CREATIVE PROCESSES.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
During all the ages there has been one bright and glittering page
of loftiest wisdom unrolled before the eye of man. That this page
may be read in every part, man's whole world turns him before it.
This motion apparently changes the eternally stable stars into a
moving panorama, but it is only so in appearance. The sky is a
vast, immovable dial-plate of "that clock whose pendulum ticks
ages instead of seconds," and whose time is eternity. The moon
moves among the illuminated figures, traversing the dial quickly,
like a second-hand, once a month. The sun, like a minute-hand, goes
over the dial once a year. Various planets stand for hour-hands,
moving over the dial in various periods reaching up to one hundred
and sixty-four years; while the earth, like a ship of exploration,
sails the infinite azure, bearing the observers to different points
where they may investigate the infinite problems of this mighty
machinery.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This dial not only shows present movements, but it keeps the history
of uncounted ages past ready to be
<a name="page 4"><span class="page">Page 4</span></a>
read backward in proper order; and it has glorious volumes of prophecy,
revealing the far-off future to any man who is able to look thereon,
break the seals, and read the record. Glowing stars are the alphabet
of this lofty page. They combine to form words. Meteors, rainbows,
auroras, shifting groups of stars, make pictures vast and significant
as the armies, angels, and falling stars in the Revelation of St.
John&mdash;changing and progressive pictures of infinite wisdom
and power.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Men have not yet advanced as far as those who saw the pictures John
describes, and hence the panorama is not understood. That continuous
speech that day after day uttereth is not heard; the knowledge that
night after night showeth is not seen; and the invisible things
of God from the creation of the world, even his eternal power and
Godhead, clearly discoverable from things that are made, are not
apprehended.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The greatest triumphs of men's minds have been in astronomy&mdash;and
ever must be. We have not learned its alphabet yet. We read only
easy lessons, with as many mistakes as happy guesses. But in time we
shall know all the letters, become familiar with the combinations,
be apt at their interpretation, and will read with facility the
lessons of wisdom and power that are written on the earth, blazoned
in the skies, and pictured by the flowers below and the rainbows
above.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In order to know how worlds move and develop, we must create them;
we must go back to their beginning, give their endowment of forces,
and study the laws of their unfolding. This we can easily do by that
faculty wherein man is likest his Father, a creative imagination.
God creates and embodies; we create, but
<a name="page 5"><span class="page">Page 5</span></a>
it remains in thought only. But the creation is as bright, strong,
clear, enduring, and real, as if it were embodied. Every one of
us would make worlds enough to crush us, if we could embody as
well as create. Our ambition would outrun our wisdom. Let us come
into the high and ecstatic frame of mind which Shakspeare calls
frenzy, in the exigencies of his verse, when
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,<br>
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;<br>
And, as imagination bodies forth<br>
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen<br>
Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing<br>
A local habitation and a name."
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the supremacy of our creative imagination let us make empty
space, in order that we may therein build up a new universe. Let us
wave the wand of our power, so that all created things disappear.
There is no world under our feet, no radiant clouds, no blazing
sun, no silver moon, nor twinkling stars. We look up, there is
no light; down, through immeasurable abysses, there is no form;
all about, and there is no sound or sign of being&mdash;nothing
save utter silence, utter darkness. It cannot be endured. Creation
is a necessity of mind&mdash;even of the Divine mind.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We will now, by imagination, create a monster world, every atom
of which shall be dowered with the single power of attraction.
Every particle shall reach out its friendly hand, and there shall
be a drawing together of every particle in existence. The laws
governing this attraction shall be two. When these particles are
associated together, the attraction shall be in proportion to the
mass. A given mass will pull twice
<a name="page 6"><span class="page">Page 6</span></a>
as much as one of half the size, because there is twice as much
to pull. And a given mass will be pulled twice as much as one half
as large, because there is twice as much to be pulled. A man who
weighed one hundred and fifty pounds on the earth might weigh a
ton and a half on a body as large as the sun. That shall be one law
of attraction; and the other shall be that masses attract inversely
as the square of distances between them. Absence shall affect
friendships that have a material basis. If a body like the earth
pulls a man one hundred and fifty pounds at the surface, or four
thousand miles from the centre, it will pull the same man one-fourth
as much at twice the distance, one-sixteenth as much at four times
the distance. That is, he will weigh by a spring balance thirty-seven
and a half pounds at eight thousand miles from the centre, and
nine pounds six ounces at sixteen thousand miles from the centre,
and he will weigh or be pulled by the earth 1/24 of a pound at
the distance of the moon. But the moon would be large enough and
near enough to pull twenty-four pounds on the same man, so the
earth could not draw him away. Thus the two laws of attraction of
gravitation are&mdash;1, <i>Gravity is proportioned to the quantity
of matter</i>; and 2, <i>The force of gravity varies inversely
as the square of the distance from the centre of the attracting
body</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The original form of matter is gas. Almost as I write comes the
announcement that Mr. Lockyer has proved that all the so-called
primary elements of matter are only so many different sized molecules
of one original substance&mdash;hydrogen. Whether that is true or
not, let us now create all the hydrogen we can
<a name="page 7"><span class="page">Page 7</span></a>
imagine, either in differently sized masses or in combination with
other substances. There it is! We cannot measure its bulk; we cannot
fly around it in any recordable eons of time. It has boundaries,
to be sure, for we are finite, but we cannot measure them. Let it
alone, now; leave it to itself. What follows? It is dowered simply
with attraction. The vast mass begins to shrink, the outer portions
are drawn inward. They rush and swirl in vast cyclones, thousands
of miles in extent. The centre grows compact, heat is evolved by
impact, as will be explained in Chapter II. Dull red light begins
to look like coming dawn. Centuries go by; contraction goes on;
light blazes in insufferable brightness; tornadoes, whirlpools, and
tempests scarcely signify anything as applied to such tumultuous
tossing.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There hangs the only world in existence; it hangs in empty space.
It has no tendency to rise; none to fall; none to move at all in
any direction. It seethes and, flames, and holds itself together
by attractive power, and that is all the force with which we have
endowed it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Leave it there alone, and withdraw millions of miles into space:
it looks smaller and smaller. We lose sight of those distinctive
spires of flame, those terrible movements. It only gives an even
effulgence, a steady unflickering light. Turn one quarter round.
Still we see our world, but it is at one side.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Now in front, in the utter darkness, suddenly create another world
of the same size, and at the same distance from you. There they
stand&mdash;two huge, lone bodies, in empty space. But we created
them dowered with attraction. Each instantly feels the drawing
influence of the other. They are mutually attractive, and begin to
<a name="page 8"><span class="page">Page 8</span></a>
move toward each other. They hasten along an undeviating straight
line. Their speed quickens at every mile. The attraction increases
every moment. They fly swift as thought. They dash their flaming,
seething foreheads together.
</p>

<p class="indent">
And now we have one world again. It is twice as large as before,
that is all the difference. There is no variety, neither any motion;
just simple flame, and nothing to be warmed thereby. Are our creative
powers exhausted by this effort?
</p>

</div>

<p class="indent">
No, we will create another world, and add another power to it that
shall keep them apart. That power shall be what is called the force
of inertia, which is literally no power at all; it is an inability
to originate or change motion. If a body is at rest, inertia is
that quality by which it will forever remain so, unless acted upon
by some force from without; and if a body is in motion, it will
continue on at the same speed, in a straight line, forever, unless
it is quickened, retarded, or turned from its path by some other
force. Suppose our newly created sun is 860,000 miles in diameter.
Go away 92,500,000 miles and create an earth eight thousand miles
in diameter. It instantly feels the attractive power of the sun
drawing it to itself sixty-eight
<a name="page 9"><span class="page">Page 9</span></a>
miles a second. Now, just as it starts, give this earth a push in
a line at right angles with line of fall to the sun, that shall
send it one hundred and eighty-nine miles a second. It obeys both
forces. The result is that the world moves constantly forward at
the same speed by its inertia from that first push, and attraction
momentarily draws it from its straight line, so that the new world
circles round the other to the starting-point. Continuing under
the operation of both forces, the worlds can never come together
or fly apart.
</p>

<p class="indent">
They circle about each other as long as these forces endure; for
the first world does not stand still and the second do all the
going; both revolve around the centre of gravity common to both.
In case the worlds are equal in mass, they will both take the same
orbit around a central stationary point, midway between the two.
In case their mass be as one to eighty-one, as in the case of the
earth and the moon, the centre of gravity around which both turn
will be 1/81 of the distance from the earth's centre to the moon's
centre. This brings the central point around which both worlds
swing just inside the surface of the earth. It is like an apple
attached by a string, and swung around the hand; the hand moves
a little, the apple very much.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Thus the problem of two revolving bodies is readily comprehended.
The two bodies lie in easy beds, and swing obedient to constant
forces. When another body, however, is introduced, with its varying
attraction, first on one and then on the other, complications are
introduced that only the most masterly minds can follow. Introduce
a dozen or a million bodies, and complications arise that only
Omniscience can unravel.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Let the hand swing an apple by an elastic cord. When the apple
falls toward the earth it feels another force besides that derived
from the hand, which greatly lengthens the elastic cord. To tear
it away from the earth's attraction, and make it rise, requires
additional force, and hence the string is lengthened; but when
it passes over the hand the earth attracts it downward, and the
string is very much shortened: so the moon, held by an elastic cord,
swings around the earth. From its extreme distance from the earth,
at A, Fig. 2, it rushes with increasing speed nearly a quarter of a

<span style="float: left; width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 1em;">
<span style="font-size: smaller;">

</span>

million of miles toward the sun, feeling its attraction increase
with every mile until it reaches B; then it is retarded in its
speed, by the same attraction, as it climbs back its quarter of
a million of miles away from the sun, in defiance of its power,
to C. All the while the invisible elastic force of the earth is
unweariedly maintained; and though the moon's distances vary over a
range of 31,355 miles, the moon is always in a determinable place.
A simple revolution of one world about another in a circular orbit
would be a problem of easy solution. It would always be at the
same distance from its centre, and going with the same velocity.
But there are over sixty causes that interfere with such a simple
orbit in the case of the moon, all of which causes and their
disturbances must be considered in calculating such a simple matter
as an eclipse, or predicting the moon's place as the sailors guide.
One of the most puzzling of the irregularities
<a name="page 11"><span class="page">Page 11</span></a>
of our night-wandering orb has just been explained by Professor
Hansen, of Gotha, as a curious result of the attraction of Venus.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Take a single instance of the perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn
which can be rendered evident. The times of orbital revolution of
Saturn and Jupiter are nearly as five to two. Suppose the orbits of

<span style="float: left; width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 1em;">
<span style="font-size: smaller;">
<img src="images/fig03.jpg" width="196" height="190" alt="Figure 3">
<br />
Fig. 3.&mdash;Changes of orbit by mutual attraction.
</span>
</span>

the planets to be, as in Fig. 3, both ellipses, but not necessarily
equally distant in all parts. The planets are as near as possible
at 1, 1. Drawn toward each other by mutual attraction, Jupiter's
orbit bends outward, and Saturn's becomes more nearly straight, as
shown by the dotted lines. A partial correction of this difficulty
immediately follows. As Jupiter moves on ahead of Saturn it is
held back&mdash;retarded in its orbit by that body; and Saturn is
hastened in its orbit by the attraction of Jupiter. Now greater
speed means a straighter orbit. A rifle-ball flies nearer in a
straight line than a thrown stone. A greater velocity given to a
whirled ball pulls the elastic cord far enough to give the ball
a larger orbit. Hence, being hastened, Saturn stretches out nearer
its proper orbit, and, retarded, Jupiter approaches the smaller
curve that is its true orbit.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But if they were always to meet at this point, as they would if
Jupiter made two revolutions to Saturn's one, it would be disastrous.
In reality, when Saturn has gone around two-thirds of its orbit to
2, Jupiter will have gone once and two-thirds around and overtaken
<a name="page 12"><span class="page">Page 12</span></a>
Saturn; and they will be near again, be drawn together, hastened,
and retarded, as before; their next conjunction would be at 3,
3, etc.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Now, if they always made their conjunction at points equally distant,
or at thirds of their orbits, it would cause a series of increasing
deviations; for Jupiter would be constantly swelling his orbit at
three points, and Saturn increasingly contracting his orbit at
the same points. Disaster would be easily foretold. But as their
times of orbital revolutions are not exactly in the ratio of five
and two, their points of conjunction slowly travel around the orbit,
till, in a period of nine hundred years, the starting-point is
again reached, and the perturbations have mutually corrected one
another.
</p>

<p class="indent">
For example, the total attractive effect of one planet on the other
for 450 years is to quicken its speed. The effect for the next 450
years is to retard. The place of Saturn, when all the retardations
have accumulated for 450 years, is one degree behind what it is
computed if they are not considered; and 450 years later it will
be one degree before its computed place&mdash;a perturbation of
two degrees. When a bullet is a little heavier or ragged on one
side, it will constantly swerve in that direction. The spiral groove
in the rifle, of one turn in forty-five feet, turns the disturbing
weight or raggedness from side to side&mdash;makes one error correct
another, and so the ball flies straight to the bull's-eye. So the
place of Jupiter and Saturn, though further complicated by four
moons in the case of Jupiter, and eight in the case of Saturn, and
also by perturbations caused by other planets, can be calculated
with exceeding nicety.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The difficulties would be greatly increased if the orbits
<a name="page 13"><span class="page">Page 13</span></a>
of Saturn and Jupiter, instead of being 400,000,000 miles apart, were
interlaced. Yet there are the orbits of one hundred and ninety-two
asteroids so interlaced that, if they were made of wire, no one could
be lifted without raising the whole net-work of them. Nevertheless,
all these swift chariots of the sky race along the course of their
intermingling tracks as securely as if they were each guided by an
intelligent mind. <i>They are guided by an intelligent mind and
an almighty arm.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
Still more complicated is the question of the mutual attractions of
all the planets. Lagrange has been able to show, by a mathematical
genius that seems little short of omniscience in his single department
of knowledge, that there is a discovered system of oscillations,
affecting the entire planetary system, the periods of which are
immensely long. The number of these oscillations is equal to that
of all the planets, and their periods range from 50,000 to 2,000,000
years,
</p>

<p class="indent">
Looking into the open page of the starry heavens we see double
stars, the constituent parts of which must revolve around a centre
common to them both, or rush to a common ruin. Eagerly we look
to see if they revolve, and beholding them in the very act, we
conclude, not groundlessly, that the same great law of gravitation
holds good in distant stellar spaces, and that there the same sufficient
mind plans, and the same sufficient power directs and controls all
movements in harmony and security.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When we come to the perturbations caused by the mutual attractions
of the sun, nine planets, twenty moons, one hundred and ninety-two
asteroids, millions
<a name="page 14"><span class="page">Page 14</span></a>
of comets, and innumerable meteoric bodies swarming in space, and
when we add to all these, that belong to one solar system, the
attractions of all the systems of the other suns that sparkle on
a brilliant winter night, we are compelled to say, "As high as the
heavens are above the earth, so high above our thoughts and ways
must be the thoughts and ways of Him who comprehends and directs
them all."

<i>CREATIVE PROGRESS.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
Worlds would be very imperfect and useless when simply endowed
with attraction and inertia, if no time were allowed for these
forces to work out their legitimate results. We want something
more than swirling seas of attracted gases, something more than
compacted rocks. We look for soil, verdure, a paradise of beauty,
animal life, and immortal minds. Let us go on with the process.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Light is the child of force, and the child, like its father, is
full of power. We dowered our created world with but a single
quality&mdash;a force of attraction. It not only had attraction for
its own material substance, but sent out an all-pervasive attraction
into space. By the force of condensation it flamed like a sun,
and not only lighted its own substance, but it filled all space
with the luminous outgoings of its power. A world may be limited,
but its influence cannot; its body may have bounds, but its soul
is infinite. Everywhere is its manifestation as real, power as
effective, presence as actual, as at the central point. He that
studies ponderable bodies alone is not studying the universe, only
its skeleton. Skeletons are somewhat interesting in themselves,
but far more so when covered with flesh, flushed with beauty, and
inspired with soul. The universe has bones,
<a name="page 18"><span class="page">Page 18</span></a>
flesh, beauty, soul, and all is one. It can be understood only by
a study of all its parts, and by tracing effect to cause.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But how can condensation cause light? Power cannot be quiet. The
mighty locomotive trembles with its own energy. A smitten piece
of iron has all its infinitesimal atoms set in vehement commotion;
they surge back and forth among themselves, like the waves of a
storm-blown lake. Heat is a mode of motion. A heated body commences
a vigorous vibration among its particles, and communicates these
vibrations to the surrounding air and ether. When these vibrations
reach 396,000,000,000,000 per second, the human eye, fitted to be
affected by that number, discerns the emitted undulations, and the
object seems to glow with a dull red light; becoming hotter, the
vibrations increase in rapidity. When they reach 765,000,000,000,000
per second the color becomes violet, and the eye can observe them no
farther. Between these numbers are those of different rapidities,
which affect the eye&mdash;as orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,
in an almost infinite number of shades&mdash;according to the
sensitiveness of the eye.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We now see how our dark immensity of attractive atoms can become
luminous. A force of compression results in vibrations within,
communicated to the ether, discerned by the eye. Illustrations are
numerous. If we suddenly push a piston into a cylinder of brass,
the force produces heat enough to set fire to an inflammable substance
within. Strike a half-inch cube of iron a moderate blow and it
becomes warm; a sufficient blow, and its vibrations become quick
enough to be seen&mdash;it is red-hot. Attach a thermometer to
an extended
<a name="page 19"><span class="page">Page 19</span></a>
arm of a whirling wheel; drive it against the air five hundred
feet per second, the mercury rises 16&deg;. The earth goes 98,000
feet per second, or one thousand miles a minute. If it come to
an aerolite or mass of metallic rock, or even a cloudlet of gas,
standing still in space, its contact with our air evolves 600,000&deg;
of heat. And when the meteor comes toward the world twenty-six
miles a second, the heat would become proportionally greater if
the meteor could abide it, and not be consumed in fervent heat.
It vanishes almost as soon as seen. If there were meteoric masses
enough lying in our path, our sky would blaze with myriads of flashes
of light. Enough have been seen to enable a person to read by them
at night. If a sufficient number were present, we should miss their
individual flashes as they blend their separate fires in one sea
of insufferable glory. The sun is 1,300,000 times as large as our
planet; its attraction proportionally greater; the aerolites more
numerous; and hence an infinite hail of stones, small masses and
little worlds, makes ceaseless trails of light, whose individuality
is lost in one dazzling sea of glory.
</p>

<p class="indent">
On the 1st day of September, 1859, two astronomers, independently
of each other, saw a sudden brightening on the surface of the sun.
Probably two large meteoric masses were travelling side by side
at two or three hundred miles per second, and striking the sun's
atmosphere, suddenly blazed into light bright enough to be seen
on the intolerable light of the photosphere as a background. The
earth responded to this new cause of brilliance and heat in the
sun. Vivid auroras appeared, not only at the north and south poles,
but even where such spectacles are seldom seen. The electro-magnetic
<a name="page 20"><span class="page">Page 20</span></a>
disturbances were more distinctly marked. "In many places the
telegraphic wires struck work. In Washington and Philadelphia the
electric signalmen received severe electric shocks; at a station in
Norway the telegraphic apparatus was set fire to; and at Boston a
flame of fire followed the pen of Bain's electric telegraph." There
is the best of reason for believing that a continuous succession
of such bodies might have gone far toward rendering the earth
uncomfortable as a place of residence.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Of course, the same result of heat and light would follow from
compression, if a body had the power of contraction in itself. We
endowed every particle of our gas, myriads of miles in extent, with an
attraction for every other particle. It immediately compressed itself
into a light-giving body, which flamed out through the interstellar
spaces, flushing all the celestial regions with exuberant light.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But heat exerts a repellent force among particles, and soon an
equilibrium is reached, for there comes a time when the contracting
body can contract no farther. But heat and light radiate away into
cold space, then contraction goes on evolving more light, and so
the suns flame on through the millions of years unquenched. It is
estimated that the contraction of our sun, from filling immensity
of space to its present size, could not afford heat enough to last
more than 18,000,000 years, and that its contraction from its present
density (that of a swamp) to such rock as that of which our earth
is composed, could supply heat enough for 17,000,000 years longer.
But the far-seeing mind of man knows a time must come when the
present force of attraction
<a name="page 21"><span class="page">Page 21</span></a>
shall have produced all the heat it can, and a new force of attraction
must be added, or the sun itself will become cold as a cinder, dead
as a burned-out char.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Since light and heat are the product of such enormous cosmic forces,
they must partake of their nature, and be force. So they are. The
sun has long arms, and they are full of unconquerable strength
ninety-two millions, or any other number of millions, of miles
away. All this light and heat comes through space that is 200&deg;
below zero, through utter darkness, and appears only on the earth.
So the gas is darkness in the underground pipes, but light at the
burner. So the electric power is unfelt by the cable in the bosom
of the deep, but is expressive of thought and feeling at the end.
Having found the cause of light, we will commence a study of its
qualities and powers.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Light is the astronomer's necessity. When the sublime word was
uttered, "Let there be light!" the study of astronomy was made
possible. Man can gather but little of it with his eye; so he takes
a lens twenty-six inches in diameter, and bends all the light that
passes through it to a focus, then magnifies the image and takes
it into his eye. Or he takes a mirror, six feet in diameter, so
hollowed in the middle as to reflect all the rays falling upon it
to one point, and makes this larger eye fill his own with light.
By this larger light-gathering he discerns things for which the
light falling on his pupil one-fifth of an inch in diameter would
not be sufficient. We never have seen any sun or stars; we have
only seen the light that left them fifty minutes or years ago,
more or less. Light is the a&euml;rial sprite that carries our
measuring-rods across the infinite
<a name="page 22"><span class="page">Page 22</span></a>
spaces; light spreads out the history of that far-off beginning;
brings us the measure of stars a thousand times brighter than our
sun; takes up into itself evidences of the very constitutional
elements of the far-off suns, and spreads them at our feet. It is
of such capacity that the Divine nature, looking for an expression
of its own omnipotence, omniscience, and power of revelation, was
content to say, "God is Light." We shall need all our delicacy of
analysis and measurement when we seek to determine the activities
of matter so fine and near to spirit as light.

Fig. 4.&mdash;Velocity of Light measured by Eclipses of Jupiter's
Moons.
</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">
We first seek the velocity of light. In Fig. 4 the earth is 92,500,000
miles from the sun at E; Jupiter is 480,000,000 miles from the sun
at J. It has four moons: the inner one goes around the central
body in forty-two hours, and is eclipsed at every revolution. The
light that went out from the sun to M ceases to be reflected back
to the earth by the intervention of the planet Jupiter. We know
to a second when these eclipses take place, and they can be seen
with a small telescope. But when the earth is on the opposite side
of the sun
<a name="page 23"><span class="page">Page 23</span></a>
from Jupiter, at E', these eclipses at J' take place sixteen and
a half minutes too late. What is the reason? Is the celestial
chronometry getting deranged? No, indeed; these great worlds swing
never an inch out of place, nor a second out of time. By going to
the other side of the sun the earth is 184,000,000 miles farther
from Jupiter, and the light that brings the intelligence of that
eclipse consumes the extra time in going over the extra distance.
Divide one by the other and we get the velocity, 185,000 miles

<span style="float: left; width: 274px; text-align: center; margin: 1em;">

<br />
Fig. 5.&mdash;Measuring the Velocity of Light.
</span>
</span>

per second. That is probably correct to within a thousand miles.
Methods of measurement by the toothed wheel of Fizeau confirm this
result. Suppose the wheel, Fig. 5, to have one thousand teeth,
making five revolutions to the second. Five thousand flashes of
light each second will dart out. Let each flash travel nine miles
to a mirror and return. If it goes that distance in 1/10000 of a
second, or at the rate of 180,000 miles a second, the next tooth
will have arrived before the eye, and each returning ray be cut
off. Hasten the revolutions a little, and the next notch will then
admit the ray, on its return, that went out of each previous notch:
the eighteen miles having been traversed meanwhile. The method of
measuring by means of a revolving mirror, used by Faucault, is
held to be even more accurate.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When we take instantaneous photographs by the exposure
<a name="page 24"><span class="page">Page 24</span></a>
of the sensitive plate 1/20000 part of a second, a stream of light
nine miles long dashes in upon the plate in that very brief period
of time.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The highest velocity we can give a rifle-ball is 2000 feet a second,
the next second it is only 1500 feet, and soon it comes to rest.
We cannot compact force enough behind a bit of lead to keep it
flying. But light flies unweariedly and without diminution of speed.
When it has come from the sun in eight minutes, Alpha Centauri
in three years, Polaris in forty-five years, other stars in one
thousand, its wings are in nowise fatigued, nor is the rapidity
of its flight slackened in the least.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is not the transactions of to-day that we read in the heavens,
but it is history, some of it older than the time of Adam. Those
stars may have been smitten out of existence decades of centuries
ago, but their poured-out light is yet flooding the heavens.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It goes both ways at once in the same place, without interference.
We see the light reflected from the new moon to the earth; reflected
back from the house-tops, fields, and waters of earth, to the moon
again, and from the moon to us once more&mdash;three times in opposite
directions, in the same place, without interference, and thus we
see "the old moon in the arms of the new."
</p>

<h3><i>Constitution of Light.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
Light was once supposed to be corpuscular, or consisting of transmitted
particles. It is now known to be the result of undulations in ether.
Reference has been made to the minuteness of these undulations.
Their velocity is equally wonderful. Put a prism of glass into
a ray of light coming into a dark room, and it is
<a name="page 25"><span class="page">Page 25</span></a>
instantly turned out of its course, some parts more and some less,
according to the number of vibrations, and appears as the seven
colors on different parts of the screen. Fig. 6 shows the arrangement
of colors, and the number of millions of millions of vibrations
per second of each. But the different divisions we call colors are

<span style="float: left; width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 1em;">
<span style="font-size: smaller;">
<img src="images/fig06.jpg" width="406" height="296" alt="Figure 6">
<br />
Fig. 6.&mdash;White Light resolved into Colors.
</span>
</span>

not colors in themselves at all, but simply a different number of
vibrations. Color is all in the eye. Violet has in different places
from 716 to 765,000,000,000,000 of vibrations per second; red has,
in different places, from 396 to 470,000,000,000,000 vibrations
per second. None of these in any sense are color, but affect the
eye differently, and we call these different effects color. They
are simply various velocities of vibration. An object, like one
kind of stripe in our flag, which absorbs all kinds of vibrations
except those between 396 and 470,000,000,000,000, and reflects those,
appears red to us. The field for the stars absorbs and destroys all
but those vibrations numbering about 653,000,000,000,000 of vibrations
<a name="page 26"><span class="page">Page 26</span></a>
per second. A color is a constant creation. Light makes momentary
color in the flag. Drake might have written, in the continuous
present as well as in the past,
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"Freedom mingles with its gorgeous dyes<br>
The milky baldrick of the skies,<br>
And stripes its pore celestial white<br>
With streakings of the morning light."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Every little pansy, tender as fancy, pearled with evanescent dew,
fresh as a new creation of sunbeams, has power to suppress in one
part of its petals all vibrations we call red, in another those
we call yellow, and purple, and reflect each of these in other
parts of the same tender petal. "Pansies are for thoughts," even
more thoughts than poor Ophelia knew. An evening cloud that is
dense enough to absorb all the faster and weaker vibrations, leaving
only the stronger to come through, will be said to be red; because
the vibrations that produce the impression we have so named are
the only ones that have vigor enough to get through. It is like an
army charging upon a fortress. Under the deadly fire and fearful
obstructions six-sevenths go down, but one-seventh comes through
with the glory of victory upon its face.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Light comes in undulations to the eye, as tones of sound to the
ear. Must not light also sing? The lowest tone we can hear is made
by 16.5 vibrations of air per second; the highest, so shrill and
"fine that nothing lives 'twixt it and silence," is made by 38,000
vibrations per second. Between these extremes lie eleven octaves;
C of the G clef having 258-7/8 vibrations to the second, and its
octave above 517-1/2. Not that sound vibrations cease
<a name="page 27"><span class="page">Page 27</span></a>
at 38,000, but our organs are not fitted to hear beyond those
limitations. If our ears were delicate enough, we could hear even
up to the almost infinite vibrations of light. In one of those
semi-inspirations we find in Shakspeare's works, he says&mdash;
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"There's not the smallest orb which thou beholdest,<br>
But in his motion like an angel sings,<br>
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubim.<br>
Such harmony is in immortal souls;<br>
But, whilst this muddy vesture of decay<br>
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it."
</p>

<p class="indent">
And that older poetry which is always highest truth says, "The
morning stars sing together." We misconstrued another passage which
we could not understand, and did not dare translate as it was written,
till science crept up to a perception of the truth that had been
standing there for ages, waiting a mind that could take it in.
Now we read as it is written&mdash;"Thou makest the out-goings
of the morning and evening to sing." Were our senses fine enough,
we could hear the separate keynote of every individual star. Stars
differ in glory and in power, and so in the volume and pitch of
their song. Were our hearing sensitive enough, we could hear not
only the separate key-notes but the infinite swelling harmony of
these myriad stars of the sky, as they pour their mighty tide of
united anthems in the ear of God:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"In reason's ear they all rejoice,<br>
And utter forth a glorious voice.<br>
Forever singing, as they shine,<br>
The hand that made us is divine."
</p>

<p class="indent">
This music is not monotonous. Stars draw near each other, and make
a light that is unapproachable by mortals;
<a name="page 28"><span class="page">Page 28</span></a>
then the music swells beyond our ability to endure. They recede
far away, making a light so dim that the music dies away, so near
to silence that only spirits can perceive it. No wonder God rejoices
in his works. They pour into his ear one ceaseless tide of rapturous
song.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Our senses are limited&mdash;we have only five, but there is room
for many more. Some time we shall be taken out of "this muddy vesture
of decay," no longer see the universe through crevices of our
prison-house, but shall range through wider fields, explore deeper
mysteries, and discover new worlds, hints of which have never yet
been blown across the wide Atlantic that rolls between them and
men abiding in the flesh.
</p>

<h3><i>Chemistry of Suns revealed by Light.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
When we examine the assemblage of colors spread from the white ray
of sunlight, we do not find red simple red, yellow yellow, etc.,
but there is a vast number of fine microscopic lines of various
lengths, parallel&mdash;here near together, there far apart, always
the same number and the same relative distance, when the same light
and prism are used. What new alphabets to new realms of knowledge
are these! Remember, that what we call colors are only various
numbers of vibrations of ether. Remember, that every little group in
the infinite variety of these vibrations may be affected differently
from every other group. One number of these is bent by the prism
to where we see what we call the violet, another number to the
place we call red. All of the vibrations are destroyed when they
strike a surface we call black. A part of them are destroyed when they
<a name="page 29"><span class="page">Page 29</span></a>
strike a substance we call colored. The rest are reflected, and
give the impression of color. In one place on the flag of our nation
all vibrations are destroyed except the red; in another, all but
the blue. Perhaps on that other gorgeous flag, not of our country
but of our sun, the flag we call the solar spectrum, all vibrations
are destroyed where these dark lines appear. Perhaps this effect
is not produced by the surface upon which the rays fall, but by
some specific substance in the sun. This is just the truth. Light
passing through vapor of sodium has the vibrations that would fall
on two narrow lines in the yellow utterly destroyed, leaving two
black spaces. Light passing through vapor of burning iron has some
four hundred numbers or kinds of vibrations destroyed, leaving
that number of black lines; but if the salt or iron be glowing
gas, in the source of the light itself the same lines are bright
instead of dark.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Thus we have brought to our doors a readable record of the very
substances composing every world hot enough to shine by its own
light. Thus, while our flag means all we have of liberty, free as
the winds that kiss it, and bright as the stars that shine in it,
the flag of the sun means all that it is in constituent elements,
all that it is in condition.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We find in our sun many substances known to exist in the earth,
and some that we had not discovered when the sun wrote their names,
or rather made their mark, in the spectrum. Thus, also, we find
that Betelguese and Algol are without any perceivable indications
of hydrogen, and Sirius has it in abundance. What a sense of
acquaintanceship it gives us to look up and recognize
<a name="page 30"><span class="page">Page 30</span></a>
the stars whose very substance we know! If we were transported
thither, or beyond, we should not be altogether strangers in an
unknown realm.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the stars differ in their constituent elements; every ray that
flashes from them bears in its very being proofs of what they are.
Hence the eye of Omniscience, seeing a ray of light anywhere in
the universe, though gone from its source a thousand years, would
be able to tell from what orb it originally came.

<h3><i>Creative Force of Light.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
Just above the color vibrations of the unbraided sunbeam, above
the violet, which is the highest number our eyes can detect, is
a chemical force; it works the changes on the glass plate in
photography; it transfigures the dark, cold soil into woody fibre,
green leaf, downy rose petals, luscious fruit, and far pervasive
odor; it flushes the wide acres of the prairie with grass and flowers,
fills the valleys with trees, and covers the hills with corn, a
single blade of which all the power of man could not make.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This power is also fit and able to survive. The engineer Stephenson
once asked Dr. Buckland, "What is the power that drives that train?"
pointing to one thundering by. "Well, I suppose it is one of your
big engines." "But what drives the engine?" "Oh, very likely a canny
Newcastle driver." "No, sir," said the engineer, "it is sunshine."
The doctor was too dull to take it in. Let us see if we can trace
such an evident effect to that distant cause. Ages ago the warm
sunshine, falling on the scarcely lifted hills of Pennsylvania,
caused the reedy vegetation to grow along the banks of
<a name="page 31"><span class="page">Page 31</span></a>
shallow seas, accumulated vast amounts of this vegetation, sunk
it beneath the sea, roofed it over with sand, compacted the sand
into rock, and changed this vegetable matter&mdash;the products
of the sunshine&mdash;into coal; and when it was ready, lifted
it once more, all garnered for the use of men, roofed over with
mighty mountains. We mine the coal, bring out the heat, raise the
steam, drive the train, so that in the ultimate analyses it is
sunshine that drives the train. These great beds of coal are nothing
but condensed sunshine&mdash;the sun's great force, through ages
gone, preserved for our use to-day. And it is so full of force
that a piece of coal that will weigh three pounds (as big as a
large pair of fists) has as much power in it as the average man
puts into a day's work. Three tons of coal will pump as much water
or shovel as much sand as the average man will pump or shovel in
a lifetime; so that if a man proposes to do nothing but work with
his muscles, he had better dig three tons of coal and set that to
do his work and then die, because his work will be better done,
and without any cost for the maintenance of the doer.

<p class="indent">
Come down below the color vibrations, and we shall find that those
which are too infrequent to be visible, manifest as heat. Naturally
there will be as many different kinds of heat as tints of color,
because there is as great a range of numbers of vibration. It is
our privilege to sift them apart and sort them over, and find what
kinds are best adapted to our various uses.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Take an electric lamp, giving a strong beam of light and heat, and
with a plano-convex lens gather it into a single beam and direct
it upon a thermometer, twenty feet away, that is made of glass
and filled with air. The
<a name="page 32"><span class="page">Page 32</span></a>
expansion or contraction of this air will indicate the varying
amounts of heat. Watch your air-thermometer, on which the beam
of heat is pouring, for the result. There is none. And yet there
is a strong current of heat there. Put another kind of test of
heat beyond it and it appears; coat the air-thermometer with a
bit of black cloth, and that will absorb heat and reveal it. But
why not at first? Because the glass lens stops all the heat that
can affect glass. The twenty feet of air absorbs all the heat that
affects air, and no kind of heat is left to affect an instrument
made of glass and air; but there are kinds of heat enough to affect
instruments made of other things.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A very strong current of heat may be sent right through the heart
of a block of ice without melting the ice at all or cooling off
the heat in the least. It is done in this way: Send the beam of
heat through water in a glass trough, and this absorbs all the heat
that can affect water or ice, getting itself hot, and leaving all
other kinds of heat to go through the ice beyond; and appropriate
tests show that as much heat comes out on the other side as goes
in on this side, and it does not melt the ice at all. Gunpowder
may be exploded by heat sent through ice. Dr. Kane, years ago,
made this experiment. He was coming down from the north, and fell
in with some Esquimaux, whom he was anxious to conciliate. He said
to the old wizard of the tribe, "I am a wizard; I can bring the
sun down out of the heavens with a piece of ice." That was a good,
deal to say in a country where there was so little sun. "So," he
writes, "I took my hatchet, chipped a small piece of ice into the
form of a double-convex lens,
<a name="page 33"><span class="page">Page 33</span></a>
smoothed it with my warm hands, held it up to the sun, and, as
the old man was blind, I kindly burned a blister on the back of
his hand to show him I could do it."
</p>

<p class="indent">
These are simple illustrations of the various kinds of heat. The
best furnace or stove ever invented consumes fifteen times as much
fuel to produce a given amount of heat as the furnace in our bodies
consumes to produce a similar amount. We lay in our supplies of
carbon at the breakfast, dinner, and supper table, and keep ourselves
warm by economically burning it with the oxygen we breathe.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Heat associated with light has very different qualities from that
which is not. Sunlight melts ice in the middle, bottom, and top at
once. Ice in the spring-time is honey-combed throughout. A piece
of ice set in the summer sunshine crumbles into separate crystals.
Dark heat only melts the surface.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Nearly all the heat of the sun passes through glass without hinderance;
but take heat from white-hot platinum and only seventy-six per
cent. of it goes through glass, twenty-four per cent. being so
constituted that it cannot pass with facility. Of heat from copper
at 752&deg; only six per cent. can go through glass, the other
ninety-four per cent. being absorbed by it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The heat of the sun beam goes through glass without
<a name="page 34"><span class="page">Page 34</span></a>
any hinderance whatever. It streams into the room as freely as
if there were no glass there. But what if the furnace or stove
heat went through glass with equal facility? We might as well try
to heat our rooms with the window-panes all out, and the blast
of winter sweeping through them.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The heat of the sun, by its intense vibrations, comes to the earth
dowered with a power which pierces the miles of our atmosphere,
but if our air were as pervious to the heat of the earth, this
heat would flyaway every night, and our temperature would go down
to 200&deg; below zero. This heat comes with the light, and then,
dissociated from it, the number of its vibrations lessened, it is
robbed of its power to get away, and remains to work its beneficent
ends for our good.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Worlds that are so distant as to receive only 1/1000 of the heat
we enjoy, may have atmospheres that retain it all. Indeed it is
probable that Mars, that receives but one-quarter as much heat
as the earth, has a temperature as high as ours. The poet drew on
his imagination when he wrote:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"Who there inhabit must have other powers,<br>
Juices, and veins, and sense and life than ours;<br>
One moment's cold like theirs would pierce the bone,<br>
Freeze the heart's-blood, and turn us all to stone."
</p>

<p class="indent">
The power that journeys along the celestial spaces in the flashing
sunshine is beyond our comprehension. It accomplishes with ease
what man strives in vain to do with all his strength. At West Point
there are some links of a chain that was stretched across the river
to prevent British ships from ascending; these links were made
of two-and-a-quarter-inch iron. A powerful locomotive might tug
in vain at one of them and not stretch it the thousandth part of
an inch. But the heat of a single gas-burner, that glows with the
preserved sunlight of other ages, when suitably applied to the
link, stretches it with ease; such enormous power has a little
heat. There is a certain iron bridge across the Thames at London,
resting on arches. The warm sunshine, acting
<a name="page 35"><span class="page">Page 35</span></a>
upon the iron, stations its particles farther and farther apart.
Since the bottom cannot give way the arches must rise in the middle.
As they become longer they lift the whole bridge, and all the thundering
locomotives and miles of goods-trains cannot bring that bridge
down again until the power of the sunshine has been withdrawn.
There is Bunker Hill Monument, thirty-two feet square at the base,
with an elevation of two hundred and twenty feet. The sunshine of
every summer's day takes hold of that mighty pile of granite with
its a&euml;rial fingers, lengthens the side affected, and bends
the whole great mass as easily as one would bend a whipstock. A
few years ago we hung a plummet from the top of this monument to
the bottom. At 9 A.M. it began to move toward the west; at noon
it swung round toward the north; in the afternoon it went east of
where it first was, and in the night it settled back to its original
place.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The sunshine says to the sea, held in the grasp of gravitation,
"Rise from your bed! Let millions of tons of water fly on the wings
of the viewless air, hundreds of miles to the distant mountains,
and pour there those millions of tons that shall refresh a whole
continent, and shall gather in rivers fitted to bear the commerce
and the navies of nations." Gravitation says, "I will hold every
particle of this ocean as near the centre of the earth as I can."
Sunshine speaks with its word of power, and says, "Up and away!"
And in the wreathing mists of morning these myriads of tons rise
in the air, flyaway hundreds of miles, and supply all the Niagaras,
Mississippis and Amazons of earth. The sun says to the earth, wrapped
in the mantle of winter,
<a name="page 36"><span class="page">Page 36</span></a>
"Bloom again;" and the snows melt, the ice retires, and vegetation
breaks forth, birds sing, and spring is about us.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Thus it is evident that every force is constitutionally arranged
to be overcome by a higher, and all by the highest. Gravitation of
earth naturally and legitimately yields to the power of the sun's
heat, and then the waters fly into the clouds. It as naturally
and legitimately yields to the power of mind, and the waters of the
Red Sea are divided and stand "upright as an heap." Water naturally
bursts into flame when a bit of potassium is thrown into it, and
as naturally when Elijah calls the right kind of fire from above.
What seems a miracle, and in contravention of law, is only the
constitutional exercise of higher force over forces organized to
be swayed. If law were perfectly rigid, there could be but one
force; but many grades exist from cohesion to mind and spirit.
The highest forces are meant to have victory, and thus give the
highest order and perfectness.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Across the astronomic spaces reach all these powers, making creation
a perpetual process rather than a single act. It almost seems as
if light, in its varied capacities, were the embodiment of God's
creative power; as if, having said, "Let there be light," he need do
nothing else, but allow it to carry forward the creative processes
to the end of time. It was Newton, one of the earliest and most
acute investigators in this study of light, who said, "I seem to
have wandered on the shore of Truth's great ocean, and to have
gathered a few pebbles more beautiful than common; but the vast
ocean itself rolls before me undiscovered and unexplored."

EXPERIMENTS WITH LIGHT.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A light set in a room is seen from every place; hence light streams
in every possible direction. If put in the centre of a hollow sphere,
every point of the surface will be equally illumined. If put in
a sphere of twice the diameter, the same light will fall on all
the larger surface. The surfaces of spheres are as the squares
of their diameters; hence, in the larger sphere the surface is
illumined only one-quarter as much as the smaller. The same is true
of large and small rooms. In Fig. 7 it is apparent that the light
that falls on the first square is spread, at twice the distance,
over the second square, which is four times as large, and at three
times the distance over nine times the surface. The varying amount
of light received by each planet is also shown in fractions above
each world, the amount received by the earth being 1.

The intensity of light is easily measured. Let two lights of different
brightness, as in Fig. 8, cast shadows on the same screen. Arrange
them as to distance so that both shadows shall be equally dark.
Let them fall side by side, and study them carefully. Measure the
respective distances. Suppose one is twenty inches, the other forty.
Light varies as the square
<a name="page 38"><span class="page">Page 38</span></a>
of the distance: the square of 20 is 400, of 40 is 1600. Divide
1600 by 400, and the result is that one light is four times as
bright as the other.

<p class="indent">
Light can be handled, directed, and bent, as well as iron bars.
Darken a room and admit a beam of sunlight through a shutter, or
a ray of lamp-light through the key-hole. If there is dust in the
room it will be observed that light goes in straight lines. Because
of this men are able to arrange houses and trees in rows, the hunter
aims his rifle correctly, and the astronomer projects straight
lines to infinity. Take a hand-mirror, or better, a piece of glass
coated on one side with black varnish, and you can send your ray
anywhere. By using two mirrors, or having an assistant and using
several, you can cause a ray of light to turn as many corners as you
please. I once saw Mr. Tyndall send a ray into a glass jar filled
with smoke (Fig. 9). Admitting a slender ray through a small hole in
a card over the mouth, one ray appeared; removing the cover, the
whole jar was luminous; as the smoke disappeared in spots cavities
of darkness appeared. Turn the same ray into a tumbler of water,
it becomes
<a name="page 39"><span class="page">Page 39</span></a>
faintly visible; stir into it a teaspoonful of milk, then turn
in the ray of sunlight, and it glows like a lamp, illuminating
the whole room. These experiments show how the straight rays of
the sun are diffused in every direction over the earth.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Set a small light near one edge of a mirror; then, by putting the
eye near the opposite edge, you see almost as many flames as you
please from the multiplied reflections. How can this be accounted for?

Into your beam of sunlight, admitted through a half-inch hole,
put the mirror at an oblique angle; you can arrange it so as to
throw half a dozen bright spots on the opposite wall.

In Fig. 10 the sunbeam enters at A, and, striking the mirror <i>m</i>
at <i>a</i>, is partly reflected to 1 on the wall, and partly enters
the glass, passes through to the silvered back at B, and is totally
reflected to <i>b</i>, where it again divides, some of it going to
the wall at 2, and the rest, continuing to make the same reflections
and divisions, causes spots 3, 4, 5, etc. The brightest spot is
at No.2, because the silvered glass at B is the best reflector
and has the most light.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When the discovery of the moons of Mars was announced in 1877,
it was also widely published that they could be seen by a mirror.
Of course this is impossible. The point of light mistaken for the
moon in this secondary reflection was caused by holding the mirror
in an oblique position.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Take a small piece of mirror, say an inch in surface, and putting
under it three little pellets of wax, putty, or clay, set it on
the wrist, with one of the pellets on the pulse. Hold the mirror
steadily in the beam of light, and the frequency and prominence of
each pulse-beat will be indicated by the tossing spot of light on
the wall. If the operator becomes excited the fact will be evident
to all observers.

<a name="page 40"><span class="page">Page 40</span></a>
to rise into sight. When light passes from a medium of one density
to a medium of another, its direction is changed. Thus a stick
in water seems bent. Ships below the horizon are sometimes seen
above, because of the different density of the layers of air.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Thus light coming from the interstellar spaces, and entering our
atmosphere, is bent down more and more by its increasing density.
The effect is greatest when the sun or star is near the horizon,
none at all in the zenith. This brings the object into view before
it is risen. Allowance for this displacement is made in all delicate
astronomical observations.

Take a bit of red paper that matches the red color of the spectrum.
Move it along the line of colors toward the violet. In the orange

black. That is because there are no more red rays to be reflected
by it. So a green object is true to its color only in the green
rays, and black elsewhere. All these colors may be recombined by
a second prism into white light.

<p class="subtitle"><i>THE TELESCOPE.</i></p>

<p class="indent">
Frequent allusion has been made in the previous chapter to discovered
results. It is necessary to understand more clearly the process by
which such results have been obtained. Some astronomical instruments
are of the simplest character, some most delicate and complex.
When a man smokes a piece of glass, in order to see an eclipse
of the sun, he makes a simple instrument. Ferguson, lying on his
back and slipping beads on a string at a certain distance above
his eye, measured the relative distances of the stars. The use
of more complex instruments commenced when Galileo applied the
telescope to the heavens. He cannot be said to have invented the
telescope, but he certainly constructed his own without a pattern,
and used it to good purpose. It consists of a lens, O B (Fig. 13),
which acts as a multiple prism to bend all the rays to one point
at R. Place the eye there, and it receives as much light as if it
were as large as the lens O B. The rays, however, are convergent,
and the point difficult to
<a name="page 44"><span class="page">Page 44</span></a>
find. Hence there is placed at R a concave lens, passing through
which the rays emerge in parallel lines, and are received by the
eye. Opera-glasses are made upon precisely this principle to-day,
because they can be made conveniently short.
</p>

Fig. 13.&mdash;Refracting Telescope.
</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">
If, instead of a concave lens at R, converting the converging rays
into parallel ones, we place a convex or magnifying lens, the minute
image is enlarged as much as an object seems diminished when the
telescope is reversed. This is the grand principle of the refracting
telescope. Difficulties innumerable arise as we attempt to enlarge
the instruments. These have been overcome, one after another, until
it is now felt that the best modern telescope, with an object lens
of twenty-six inches, has fully reached the limit of optical power.
</p>

<h3><i>The Reflecting Telescope</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">
This is the only kind of instrument differing radically from the
refracting one already described. It receives the light in a concave
mirror, M (Fig. 14), which reflects it to the focus F, producing the
same result as the lens of the refracting telescope. Here a mirror
may be placed obliquely, reflecting the image at right angles to the
eye, outside the tube, in which case it is called the Newtonian
telescope; or a mirror at R may be placed perpendicularly, and send
the rays through
<a name="page 45"><span class="page">Page 45</span></a>
an opening in the mirror at M. This form is called the Gregorian
telescope. Or the mirror M may be slightly inclined to the coming
rays, so as to bring the point F entirely outside the tube, in
which case it is called the Herschelian telescope. In either case
the image may be magnified, as in the refracting telescope.

</div>

<p class="indent">
Reflecting telescopes are made of all sizes, up to the Cyclopean
eye of the one constructed by Lord Rosse, which is six feet in
diameter. The form of instrument to be preferred depends on the
use to which it is to be put. The loss of light in passing through
glass lenses is about two-tenths. The loss by reflection is often
one-half. In view of this peculiarity and many others, it is held
that a twenty-six-inch refractor is fully equal to any six-foot
reflector.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The mounting of large telescopes demands the highest engineering
ability. The whole instrument, with its vast weight of a twenty-six-inch
glass lens, with its accompanying tube and appurtenances, must be
pointed as nicely as a rifle, and held as steadily as the axis
of the globe. To give it the required steadiness, the foundation
on which it is placed is sunk deep in the earth, far from rail or
other roads, and no part of the observatory is allowed to touch
this support. When a star is once found, the earth swiftly rotates
the telescope away from it, and it passes out of the field. To
avoid this, clock-work is so arranged that the great telescope
follows the star by the hour, if required. It will take a star at
its eastern rising, and hold it constantly in view while it climbs
to the meridian and sinks in the west (Fig. 15). The reflector
demands still more difficult engineering. That of Lord Rosse has
a metallic mirror
<a name="page 46"><span class="page">Page 46</span></a>
weighing six tons, a tube forty feet long, which, with its
appurtenances, weighs seven tons more. It moves between two walls
only 10&deg; east and west. The new Paris reflector (Fig. 16) has
a much wider range of movement.

<h3><i>The Spectroscope.</i></h3>

A spectrum is a collection of the colors which are dispersed by
a prism from any given light. If it is sunlight, it is a solar
spectrum; if the source of light is a

star, candle, glowing metal, or gas, it is the spectrum of a star,
candle, glowing metal, or gas. An instrument to see these spectra
is called a spectroscope. Considering the infinite variety of light,
and its easy modification and absorption, we should expect an immense
number of spectra. A mere prism disperses the light so imperfectly
that different orders of vibrations, perceived as colors, are mingled.
No eye can tell where one commences or ends. Such a spectrum is
said to be impure. What we want is that each point in the spectrum
should be made of rays of the same number of vibrations. As we can
let only a small beam of light pass through the prism, in studying
celestial objects with a telescope and spectroscope we must, in

every instance, contract the aperture of the instrument until we get
only a small beam of light. In order to have the colors thoroughly
dispersed, the best instruments pass the beam of light through
a series of prisms called a battery, each one spreading farther
the colors which the previous ones had spread. In Fig. 17 the ray
is seen entering through the telescope A, which renders the rays
parallel, and passing
<a name="page 50"><span class="page">Page 50</span></a>
through the prisms out to telescope B, where the spectrum can be
examined on the retina of the eye for a screen. In order to still
farther disperse the rays, some batteries receive the ray from the
last prism at O upon an oblique mirror, send it up a little to
another, which delivers it again to the prism to make its journey
back again through them all, and come out to be examined just above
where it entered the first prism.

<p class="indent">
Attached to the examining telescope is a diamond-ruled scale of glass,
enabling us to fix the position of any line with great exactness.

In Fig. 18 is seen, in the lower part, a spectrum of the sun, with
about a score of its thousands of lines made evident. In the upper
part is seen the spectrum of bright lines given by glowing hydrogen
gas. These lines are given by no other known gas; they are its
autograph. It is readily observed that they precisely correspond
with certain dark lines in the solar spectrum. Hence we easily
know that a glowing gas gives the same bright lines that it absorbs
from the light of another source passing through it&mdash;that
is, glowing gas gives out the same rays of light that it absorbs
when it is not glowing.

<p class="indent">
The subject becomes clearer by a study of the chromolithic plate.
No. 1 represents the solar spectrum, with a few of its lines on
an accurately graduated scale.
<a name="page 51"><span class="page">Page 51</span></a>
No.3 shows the bright line of glowing sodium, and, corresponding
to a dark line in the solar spectrum, shows the presence of salt
in that body. No. 2 shows that potassium has some violet rays, but
not all; and there being no dark line to correspond in the solar
spectrum, we infer its absence from the sun. No.6 shows the numerous
lines and bands of barium&mdash;several red, orange, yellow, and
four are very bright green ones. The lines given by any volatilized
substances are always in the same place on the scale.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A patient study of these signs of substances reveals, richer results
than a study of the cuniform characters engraved on Assyrian slabs;
for one is the handwriting of men, the other the handwriting of
God.

<p class="indent">
One of the most difficult and delicate problems solved by the
spectroscope is the approach or departure of a light-giving body
in the line of sight. Stand before a locomotive a mile away, you
cannot tell whether it approaches or recedes, yet it will dash by
in a minute. How can the movements of the stars be comprehended
when they are at such an immeasurable distance?
</p>

<p class="indent">
It can best be illustrated by music. The note C of the G clef is
made by two hundred and fifty-seven vibrations of air per second.
Twice as many vibrations per second would give us the note C an octave
above. Sound travels at the rate of three hundred and sixty-four
yards per second. If the source of these two hundred and fifty-seven
vibrations could approach us at three hundred and sixty-four yards
per second, it is obvious that twice as many waves would be put
into a given space, and we should hear the upper C when only waves
enough were made for the lower C. The same
<a name="page 52"><span class="page">Page 52</span></a>
result would appear if we carried our ear toward the sound fast
enough to take up twice as many valves as though we stood still.
This is apparent to every observer in a railway train. The whistle
of an approaching locomotive gives one tone; it passes, and we
instantly detect another. Let two trains, running at a speed of
thirty-six yards a second, approach each other. Let the whistle
of one sound the note E, three hundred and twenty-three vibrations
per second. It will be heard on the other as the note G, three
hundred and eighty-eight vibrations per second; for the speed of
each train crowds the vibrations into one-tenth less room, adding
32+ vibrations per second, making three hundred and eighty-eight
in all. The trains pass. The vibrations are put into one-tenth more
space by the whistle making them, and the other train allows only
nine-tenths of what there are to overtake the ear. Each subtracts
32+ vibrations from three hundred and twenty-three, leaving only
two hundred and fifty-eight, which is the note C. Yet the note
E was constantly uttered.

If a source of light approach or depart, it will have a similar
effect on the light waves. How shall we detect it? If a star approach
us, it puts a greater number of waves into an inch, and shortens
their length. If it recedes, it increases the length of the
wave&mdash;puts a less number into an inch. If a body giving only
the number of vibrations we call green were to approach sufficiently
fast, it would crowd in vibrations enough to appear what we call
blue, indigo, or even violet, according to its speed. If it receded
sufficiently fast, it would leave behind it only vibrations enough
to fill up the
<a name="page 53"><span class="page">Page 53</span></a>
space with what we call yellow, orange, or red, according to its
speed; yet it would be green, and green only, all the time. But how
detect the change? If red waves are shortened they become orange
in color; and from below the red other rays, too far apart to be
seen by the eye, being shortened, become visible as red, and we
cannot know that anything has taken place. So, if a star recedes
fast enough, violet vibrations being lengthened become indigo;
and from above the violet other rays, too short to be seen, become
lengthened into visible violet, and we can detect no movement of
the colors. The dark lines of the spectrum are the cutting out of
rays of definite wave-lengths. If the color spectrum moves away,
they move with it, and away from their proper place in the ordinary
spectrum. If, then, we find them toward the red end, the star is
receding; if toward the violet end, it is approaching. Turn the
instrument on the centre of the sun. The dark lines take their
appropriate place, and are recognized on the ruled scale. Turn
it on one edge, that is approaching us one and a quarter miles
a second by the revolution of the sun on its axis, the spectral
lines move toward the violet end; turn the spectroscope toward the
other edge of the sun, it is receding from us one and a quarter
miles a second by reason of the axial revolution, and the spectral
lines move toward the red end. Turn it near the spots, and it reveals
the mighty up-rush in one place and the down-rush in another of
one hundred miles a second. We speak of it as an easy matter, but
it is a problem of the greatest delicacy, almost defying the mind
of man to read the movements of matter.

<p class="indent">
It should be recognized that Professor Young, of
<a name="page 54"><span class="page">Page 54</span></a>
Princeton, is the most successful operator in this recent realm
of science. He already proposes to correct the former estimate
of the sun's axial revolutions, derived from observing its spots,
by the surer process of observing accelerated and retarded light.

Within a very few years this wonderful instrument, the spectroscope,
has made amazing discoveries. In chemistry it reveals substances
never known before; in analysis it is delicate to the detection of
the millionth of a grain. It is the most deft handmaid of chemistry,
the arts, of medical science, and astronomy. It tells the chemical
constitution of the sun, the movements taking place, the nature
of comets, and nebul&aelig;. By the spectroscope we know that the
atmospheres of Venus and Mars are like our own; that those of Jupiter
and Saturn are very unlike; it tells us which stars approach and
which recede, and just how one star differeth from another in glory
and substance.

We know that astronomy has what are called practical uses. If a
ship had been driven by Euroclydon ten times fourteen days and
nights without sun or star appearing, a moment's glance into the
heavens from the heaving deck, by a very slightly educated sailor,
would tell within one hundred yards where he was, and determine
the distance and way to the nearest port. We know that, in all
final and exact surveying, positions must be fixed by the stars.
Earth's landmarks are uncertain and easily removed; those which
we get from the heavens are stable and exact.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In 1878 the United States steam-ship <i>Enterprise</i> was sent to
survey the Amazon. Every night a "star party" went ashore to fix
the exact latitude and longitude by observations of the stars. Our
real landmarks are not the pillars we rear, but the stars millions
of miles away. All our standards of time are taken from the stars;
every railway train runs by their time to avoid collision; by them
all factories start and stop. Indeed, we are ruled by the stars
even more than the old astrologers imagined.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Man's finest mechanism, highest thought, and broadest exercise
of the creative faculty have been inspired by astronomy. No other
instruments approximate in delicacy those which explore the heavens;
no other
<a name="page 58"><span class="page">Page 58</span></a>
system of thought can draw such vast and certain conclusions from
its premises. "Too low they build who build beneath the stars;" we
should lay our foundations in the skies, and then build upward.

We have been placed on the outside of this earth, instead of the
inside, in order that we may look abroad. We are carried about,
through unappreciable distance, at the inconceivable velocity of
one thousand miles a minute, to give us different points of vision.
The earth, on its softly-spinning axle, never jars enough to unnest
a bird or wake a child; hence the foundations of our observatories
are firm, and our measurements exact. Whoever studies astronomy,
under proper guidance and in the right spirit, grows in thought
and feeling, and becomes more appreciative of the Creator.

<h3><i>Celestial Movements.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
Let it not be supposed that a mastery of mathematics and a finished
education are necessary to understand the results of astronomical
research. It took at first the highest power of mind to make the
discoveries that are now laid at the feet of the lowliest. It took
sublime faith, courage, and the results of ages of experience in
navigation, to enable Columbus to discover that path to the New
World which now any little boat can follow. Ages of experience
and genius are stored up in a locomotive, but quite an unlettered
man can drive it. It is the work of genius to render difficult
matters plain, abstruse thoughts clear.

A brief explanation of a few terms will make the principles of
world inspection easily understood. Imagine a perfect circle thirty
feet in diameter&mdash;that is, create
<a name="page 59"><span class="page">Page 59</span></a>
one (Fig. 19). Draw through it a diameter horizontally, another

perpendicularly. The angles made by the intersecting lines are
each said to be ninety degrees, marked thus &deg;. The arc of a
circle included between any two of the lines is also 90&deg;. Every
circle, great or small, is divided into these 360&deg;. If the sun
rose in the east and came to the zenith at noon, it would have
passed 90&deg;. When it set in the west it would have traversed
half the circle, or 180&deg;. In Fig. 20 the angle of the lines
measured on the graduated arc is 10&deg;. The mountain is 10&deg;
high, the world 10&deg; in diameter, the comet moves 10&deg; a
day, the stars are 10&deg; apart. The height of the mountain, the
diameter of the world, the velocity of the comet, and the distance
between the stars, depend on the distance of each from the point
of sight. Every degree is divided into 60 minutes (marked '), and
every minute into 60 seconds (marked ").

Imagine yourself inside a perfect sphere one hundred feet in diameter,
with the interior surface above, around, and below studded with
fixed bright points like stars. The familiar constellations of
night might be blazoned there in due proportion.
</p>

<p class="indent">
If this star-sprent sphere were made to revolve once in twenty-four
hours, all the stars would successively
<a name="page 60"><span class="page">Page 60</span></a>
pass in review. How easily we could measure distances between stars,
from a certain fixed meridian, or the equator! How easily we could
tell when any particular star would culminate! It is as easy to take
all these measurements when our earthly observatory is steadily
revolved within the sphere of circumambient stars. Stars can be
mapped as readily as the streets of a great city. Looking down
on it in the night, one could trace the lines of lighted streets,
and judge something of its extent and regularity. But the few lamps
of evening would suggest little of the greatness of the public
buildings, the magnificent enterprise and commerce of its citizens,
or the intelligence of its scholars. Looking up to the lamps of
the celestial city, one can judge something of its extent and
regularity; but they suggest little of the magnificence of the many
mansions.

<p class="indent">
Stars are reckoned as so many degrees, minutes, and seconds from
each other, from the zenith, or from a given meridian, or from the
equator. Thus the stars called the Pointers, in the Great Bear,
are 5&deg; apart; the nearest one is 29&deg; from the Pole Star,
which is 39&deg; 56' 29" above the horizon at Philadelphia. In
going to England you creep up toward the north end of the earth,
till the Pole Star is 54&deg; high. It stays near its place among
the stars continually,

<h3><i>How to Measure.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
Suppose a telescope, fixed to a mural circle, to revolve on an axis,
as in Fig. 21; point it horizontally at a star;
<a name="page 61"><span class="page">Page 61</span></a>
turn it up perpendicular to another star. Of course the two stars
are 90&deg; apart, and the graduated scale, which is attached to the
outer edge of the circle, shows a revolution of a quarter circle,
or 90&deg;, But a perfect accuracy of measurement must be sought;
for to mistake the breadth of a hair, seen at the distance of one
hundred and twenty-five feet, would cause an error of 3,000,000 miles
at the distance of the sun, and immensely more at the distance of the
stars. The correction of an inaccuracy of no greater magnitude than
that has reduced our estimate of the distance of our sun 3,000,000
miles.
</p>

<br />
Fig. 21.&mdash;Mural Circle.
</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">
Consider the nicety of the work. Suppose the graduated scale to
be thirty feet in circumference. Divided into 360&deg;, each would
be one inch long. Divide each degree into 60', each one is 1/60
of an inch long. It takes good eyesight to discern it. But each
minute must be
<a name="page 62"><span class="page">Page 62</span></a>
divided into 60", and these must not only be noted, but even tenths
and hundredths of seconds must be discerned. Of course they are
not seen by the naked eye; some mechanical contrivance must be
called in to assist. A watch loses two minutes a week, and hence is
unreliable. It is taken to a watch-maker that every single second
may be quickened 1/20160 part of itself. Now 1/20000 part of a
second would be a small interval of time to measure, but it must
be under control. If the temperature of a summer morning rises ten
or twenty degrees we scarcely notice it; but the magnetic tastimeter
measures 1/5000 of a degree.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Come to earthly matters. In 1874, after nearly twenty-eight years'
work, the State of Massachusetts opened a tunnel nearly five miles
long through the Hoosac Mountains. In the early part of the work
the engineers sunk a shaft near the middle 1028 feet deep. Then the
question to be settled was where to go so as to meet the approaching
excavations from the east and west. A compass could not be relied
on under a mountain. The line must be mechanically fixed. A little
divergence at the starting-point would become so great, miles away,
that the excavations might pass each other without meeting; the
grade must also rise toward the central shaft, and fall in working
away from it; but the lines were fixed with such infinitesimal
accuracy that, when the one going west from the eastern portal and
the one going east from the shaft met in the heart of the mountain,
the western line was only one-eighth of an inch too high, and
three-sixteenths of an inch too far north. To reach this perfect
result they had to triangulate from the eastern portal to distant
mountain
<a name="page 63"><span class="page">Page 63</span></a>
peaks, and thence down the valley to the central shaft, and thus
fix the direction of the proposed line across the mouth of the
shaft. Plumb-lines were then dropped one thousand and twenty-eight
feet, and thus the line at the bottom was fixed.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Three attempts were made&mdash;in 1867, 1870, and 1872&mdash;to
fix the exact time-distance between Greenwich and Washington. These
three separate efforts do not differ one-tenth of a second. Such
demonstrable results on earth greatly increase our confidence in
similar measurements in the skies.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A scale is frequently affixed to a pocket-rule, by which we can
easily measure one-hundredth of an inch (Fig. 22). The upper and

<span style="float: left; width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 1em;">

</span>
</span>

lower line is divided into tenths of an inch. Observe the slanting
line at the right hand. It leans from the perpendicular one-tenth
of an inch, as shown by noticing where it reaches the top line. When
it reaches the second horizontal line it has left the perpendicular
one-tenth of that tenth&mdash;that is, one-hundredth. The intersection
marks 99/100 of an inch from one end, and one-hundredth from the
other.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When division-lines, on measures of great nicety, get too fine
to be read by the eye, we use the microscope. By its means we are
able to count 112,000 lines ruled on a glass plate within an inch.
The smallest object that can be seen by a keen eye makes an angle
of 40", but by putting six microscopes on the scale of the telescope
on the mural circle, we are able to reach an exactness of 0".1, or
1/3600 of an inch. This instrument is used to measure the declination
of stars, or angular
<a name="page 64"><span class="page">Page 64</span></a>
distance north or south of the equator. Thus a star's place in
two directions is exactly fixed. When the telescope is mounted on
two pillars instead of the face of a wall, it is called a transit
instrument. This is used to determine the time of transit of a
star over the meridian, and if the transit instrument is provided
with a graduated circle it can also be used for the same purposes
as the mural circle. Man's capacity to measure exactly is indicated
in his ascertainment of the length of waves of light. It is easy
to measure the three hundred feet distance between the crests of
storm-waves in the wide Atlantic; easy to measure the different
wave-lengths of the different tones of musical sounds. So men measure
the lengths of the undulations of light. The shortest is of the
violet light, 154.84 ten-millionths of an inch. By the horizontal
pendulum Professor Root has made 1/36000000 of an inch apparent.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The next elements of accuracy must be perfect time and perfect
notation of time. As has been said, we get our time from the stars.
Thus the infinite and heavenly dominates the finite and earthly.
Clocks are set to the invariable sidereal time. Sidereal noon is
when we have turned ourselves under the point where the sun crosses
the equator in March, called the vernal equinox. Sidereal clocks
are figured to indicate twenty-four hours in a day: they tick exact
seconds. To map stars we wish to know the exact second when they
cross the meridian, or the north and south line in the celestial
dome above us. The telescope (Fig. 21, p. 61) swings exactly north
and south. In its focus a set of fine threads of spider-lines is
placed (Fig. 23). The telescope is set just high enough, so that
by the rolling over of the earth
<a name="page 65"><span class="page">Page 65</span></a>
the star will come into the field just above the horizontal thread.

<span style="float: left; width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 1em;">

<br />
Fig. 23.&mdash;Transit of a Star noted.
</span>
</span>

The observer notes the exact second and tenth of a second when the
star reaches each vertical thread in the instrument, adds together
the times and divides by five to get the average, and the exact
time is reached.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But man is not reliable enough to observe and record with sufficient
accuracy. Some, in their excitement, anticipate its positive passage,
and some cannot get their slow mental machinery in motion till
after it has made the transit. Moreover, men fall into a habit of
estimating some numbers of tenths of a second oftener than others.
It will be found that a given observer will say three tenths or
seven tenths oftener than four or eight. He is falling into ruts,
and not trustworthy. General O. M. Mitchel, who had been director
of the Cincinnati Observatory, once told one of his staff-officers
that he was late at an appointment. "Only a few minutes," said the
officer, apologetically. "Sir," said the general, "where I have
been accustomed to work, hundredths of a second are too important
to be neglected." And it is to the rare genius of this astronomer,
and to others, that we owe the mechanical accuracy that we now
attain. The clock is made to mark its seconds on paper wrapped
around a revolving cylinder. Under the observer's fingers is an
electric key. This he can touch at the instant of the transit of
the star
<a name="page 66"><span class="page">Page 66</span></a>
over each wire, and thus put his observation on the same line between
the seconds dotted by the clock. Of course these distances can be
measured to minute fractional parts of a second.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But it has been found that it takes an appreciable time for every
observer to get a thing into his head and out of his finger-ends,
and it takes some observers longer than others. A dozen men, seeing
an electric spark, are liable to bring down their recording marks
in a dozen different places on the revolving paper. Hence the time
that it takes for each man to get a thing into his head and out
of his fingers is ascertained. This time is called his personal
equation, and is subtracted from all of his observations in order to
get at the true time; so willing are men to be exact about material
matters. Can it be thought that moral and spiritual matters have
no precision? Thus distances east or west from any given star or
meridian are secured; those north and south from the equator or
the zenith are as easily fixed, and thus we make such accurate maps
of the heavens that any movements in the far-off stars&mdash;so
far that it may take centuries to render the swiftest movements
appreciable&mdash;may at length be recognized and accounted for.

<p class="indent">
We now come to a little study of the modes of measuring distances.
Create a perfect square (Fig. 24); draw a diagonal line. The square
angles are 90&deg;, the divided angles give two of 45&deg; each.
Now the base A B is equal to the perpendicular A C. Now any
point&mdash;C, where a perpendicular, A C, and a diagonal, B C,
meet&mdash;will be
<a name="page 67"><span class="page">Page 67</span></a>
as far from A as B is. It makes no difference if a river flows
between A and C, and we cannot go over it; we can measure its distance
as easily as if we could. Set a table four feet by eight out-doors
(Fig. 25); so arrange it that, looking along one end, the line
of sight just strikes a tree the other side of the river. Go to
the other end, and, looking toward the tree, you find the line
of sight to the tree falls an inch from the end of the table on
the farther side. The lines, therefore, approach each other one
inch in every four feet, and will come together at a tree three
hundred and eighty-four feet away.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The next process is to measure the height or magnitude of objects
at an ascertained distance. Put two pins in a stick half an inch
apart (Fig. 26). Hold it up two feet from the eye, and let the
upper pin fall in line with your eye and the top of a distant church
steeple, and the lower pin in line with the bottom of the church and
your eye. If the church is three-fourths of a mile away, it must
be eighty-two feet high; if a mile away, it must be one hundred
and ten feet high. For if two lines spread
<a name="page 68"><span class="page">Page 68</span></a>
one-half an inch going two feet, in going four feet they will spread
an inch, and in going a mile, or five thousand two hundred and
eighty feet, they will spread out one-fourth as many inches, viz.,
thirteen hundred and twenty&mdash;that is, one hundred and ten
feet. Of course these are not exact methods of measurement, and
would not be correct to a hair at one hundred and twenty-five feet,
but they perfectly illustrate the true methods of measurement.

<p class="indent">
Imagine a base line ten inches long. At each end erect a perpendicular
line. If they are carried to infinity they will never meet: will
be forever ten inches apart. But at the distance of a foot from
the base line incline one line toward the other 63/10000000 of
an inch, and the lines will come together at a distance of three
hundred miles. That new angle differs from the former right angle
almost infinitesimally, but it may be measured. Its value is about
three-tenths of a second. If we lengthen the base line from ten
inches to all the miles we can command, of course the point of
meeting will be proportionally more distant. The angle made by
the lines where they come together will be obviously the same as
the angle of divergence from a right angle at this end. That angle
is called the parallax of any body, and is the angle that would
be made by two lines coming from that body to the two ends of any
conventional base, as the semi-diameter of the earth. That that
angle would vary according to the various distances is easily seen
by Fig. 27.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Let O P be the base. This would subtend a greater angle seen from
star A than from star B. Let B be far enough away, and O P would
become invisible, and B
<a name="page 69"><span class="page">Page 69</span></a>
would have no parallax for that base. Thus the moon has a parallax
of 57" with the semi-equatorial diameter of the earth for a base. And
the sun has a parallax 8".85 on the same base. It is not necessary
to confine ourselves to right angles in these measurements, for the
same principles hold true in any angles. Now, suppose two observers

<span style="float: left; width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 1em;">
<span style="font-size: smaller;">
<img src="images/fig27.jpg" width="194" height="322" alt="Figure 27">
<br />

</span>
</span>

on the equator should look at the moon at the same instant. One is
on the top of Cotopaxi, on the west coast of South America, and
one on the west coast of Africa. They are 90&deg; apart&mdash;half
the earth's diameter between them. The one on Cotopaxi sees it
exactly overhead, at an angle of 90&deg; with the earth's diameter.
The one on the coast of Africa sees its angle with the same line
to be 89&deg; 59' 3"&mdash;that is, its parallax is 57". Try the
same experiment on the sun farther away, as is seen in Fig. 27,
and its smaller parallax is found to be only 8".85.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is not necessary for two observers to actually station themselves
at two distant parts of the earth in order to determine a parallax.
If an observer could go from one end of the base-line to the other,
he could determine both angles. Every observer is actually carried
along through space by two motions: one is that of the earth's
revolution of one thousand miles an hour around the axis; and the
other is the movement of the earth around the sun of one thousand
miles in a minute. Hence we can have the diameter not only of
<a name="page 70"><span class="page">Page 70</span></a>
the earth (eight thousand miles) for a base-line, but the diameter
of the earth's orbit (184,000,000 miles), or any part of it, for
such a base. Two observers at the ends of the earth's diameter,
looking at a star at the same instant, would find that it made the
same angle at both ends; it has no parallax on so short a base.
We must seek a longer one. Observe a certain star on the 21st of
March; then let us traverse the realms of space for six months,
at one thousand miles a minute. We come round in our orbit to a
point opposite where we were six months ago, with 184,000,000 of
miles between the points. Now, with this for a base-line, measure
the angles of the same stars: it is the same angle. Sitting in
my study here, I glance out of the window and discern separate
bricks, in houses five hundred feet away, with my unaided eye;
they subtend a discernible angle. But one thousand feet away I
cannot distinguish individual bricks; their width, being only two
inches, does not subtend an angle apprehensible to my vision. So
at these distant stars the earth's enormous orbit, if lying like
a blazing ring in space, with the world set on its edge like a
pearl, and the sun blazing like a diamond in the centre, would
all shrink to a mere point. Not quite to a point from the nearest
stars, or we should never be able to measure the distance of any
of them. Professor Airy says that our orbit, seen from the nearest
star, would be the same as a circle six-tenths of an inch in diameter
seen at the distance of a mile: it would all be hidden by a thread
one-twenty-fifth of an inch in diameter, held six hundred and fifty
feet from the eye. If a straight line could be drawn from a star,
Sirius in the east to the star Vega in the west, touching our
<a name="page 71"><span class="page">Page 71</span></a>
earth's orbit on one side, as T R A (Fig. 28), and a line were

<span style="float: left; width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 1em;">
<span style="font-size: smaller;">
<img src="images/fig28.jpg" width="279" height="95" alt="Figure 28">
<br />
Fig. 28.
</span>
</span>

to be drawn six months later from the same stars, touching our
earth's orbit on the other side, as R B T, such a line would not
diverge sufficiently from a straight line for us to detect its
divergence. Numerous vain attempts had been made, up to the year
1835, to detect and measure the angle of parallax by which we could
rescue some one or more of the stars from the inconceivable depths
of space, and ascertain their distance from us. We are ever impelled
to triumph over what is declared to be unconquerable. There are
peaks in the Alps no man has ever climbed. They are assaulted every
year by men zealous of more worlds to conquer. So these greater
heights of the heavens have been assaulted, till some ambitious
spirits have outsoared even imagination by the certainties of
mathematics.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is obvious that if one star were three times as far from us as
another, the nearer one would seem to be displaced by our movement
in our orbit three times as much as the other; so, by comparing one
star with another, we reach a ground of judgment. The ascertainment
of longitude at sea by means of the moon affords a good illustration.
Along the track where the moon sails, nine bright stars, four planets,
and the sun have been selected. The nautical almanacs give the
distance of the moon from these successive stars every hour in
the night for three years in advance. The sailor can measure the
distance at any time by his sextant. Looking from the world at
D (Fig. 29), the distance of the moon and
<a name="page 72"><span class="page">Page 72</span></a>
star is A E, which is given in the almanac. Looking from C, the
distance is only B E, which enables even the uneducated sailor to
find the distance, C D, on the earth, or his distance from Greenwich.

<p class="indent">
So, by comparisons of the near and far stars, the approximate distance
of a few of them has been determined. The nearest one is the brightest
star in the Centaur, never visible in our northern latitudes, which
has a parallax of about one second. The next nearest is No. 61 in
the Swan, or 61 Cygni, having a parallax of 0".34. Approximate
measurements have been made on Sirius, Capella, the Pole Star,
etc., about eighteen in all. The distances are immense: only the
swiftest agents can traverse them. If our earth were suddenly to
dissolve its allegiance to the king of day, and attempt a flight
to the North Star, and should maintain its flight of one thousand
miles a minute, it would flyaway toward Polaris for thousands upon
thousands of years, till a million years had passed away, before
it reached that northern dome of the distant sky, and gave its
new allegiance to another sun. The sun it had left behind it would
gradually diminish till it was small as Arcturus, then small as
could be discerned by the naked eye, until at last it would finally
fade out in utter darkness long before the new sun was reached.
Light can traverse the distance around our earth eight times in
one second. It comes in eight minutes from the sun, but it takes
three and a quarter years to come from Alpha
<a name="page 73"><span class="page">Page 73</span></a>
Centauri, seven and a quarter years from 61 Cygni, and forty-five
years from the Polar Star.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Sometimes it happens that men steer along a lee shore, dependent
for direction on Polaris, that light-house in the sky. Sometimes it
has happened that men have traversed great swamps by night when that
star was the light-housse of freedom. In either case the exigency
of life and liberty was provided for forty-five years before by a
Providence that is divine.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We do not attempt to name in miles these enormous distances; we
must seek another yard-stick. Our astronomical unit and standard of
measurement is the distance of the earth from the sun&mdash;92,500,000
miles. This is the golden reed with which we measure the celestial
city. Thus, by laying down our astronomical unit 226,000 times, we
measure to Alpha Centauri, more than twenty millions of millions
of miles. Doubtless other suns are as far from Alpha Centauri and
each other as that is from ours.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Stars are not near or far according to their brightness. 61 Cygni is
a telescopic star, while Sirius, the brightest star in the heavens,
is twice as far away from us. One star differs from another star
in intrinsic glory.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The highest testimonies to the accuracy of these celestial observations
are found in the perfect predictions of eclipses, transits of planets
over the sun, occultation of stars by the moon, and those statements
of the Nautical Almanac that enable the sailor to know exactly
where he is on the pathless ocean by the telling of the stars:
"On the trackless ocean this book is the mariner's trusted friend
and counsellor; daily and nightly its revelations bring safety
to ships in all parts of the
<a name="page 74"><span class="page">Page 74</span></a>
world. It is something more than a mere book; it is an ever-present
manifestation of the order and harmony of the universe."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Another example of this wonderful accuracy is found in tracing
the asteroids. Within 200,000,000 or 300,000,000 miles from the
sun, the one hundred and ninety-two minute bodies that have been
already discovered move in paths very nearly the same&mdash;indeed
two of them traverse the same orbit, being one hundred and eighty
degrees apart;&mdash;they look alike, yet the eye of man in a few
observations so determines the curve of each orbit, that one is
never mistaken for another. But astronomy has higher uses than
fixing time, establishing landmarks, and guiding the sailor. It
greatly quickens and enlarges thought, excites a desire to know,
leads to the utmost exactness, and ministers to adoration and love
of the Maker of the innumerable suns.

Suppose we had stood on the dome of Boston Statehouse November 9th,
1872, on the night of the great conflagration, and seen the fire
break out; seen the engines dash through the streets, tracking their
path by their sparks; seen the fire encompass a whole block, leap
the streets on every side, surge like the billows of a storm-swept
sea; seen great masses of inflammable gas rise like dark clouds
from an explosion, then take fire in the air, and, cut off from
the fire below, float like argosies of flame in space. Suppose we
had felt the wind that came surging from all points of the compass
to fan that conflagration till it was light enough a mile away to
see to read the finest print, hot enough to decompose the torrents
of water that were dashed on it, making new fuel to feed the flame.
Suppose we had seen this spreading fire seize on the whole city,
extend to its environs, and, feeding itself on the very soil, lick
up Worcester with its tongues of flame&mdash;Albany, New York,
Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati&mdash;and crossing the plains swifter
than a prairie fire, making each peak of the Rocky Mountains hold up
aloft a separate torch of flame, and the Sierras whiter with heat
than they ever were with snow, the waters of the Pacific resolve
into their constituent elements of oxygen and hydrogen, and
<a name="page 78"><span class="page">Page 78</span></a>
burn with unquenchable fire! We withdraw into the air, and see
below a world on fire. All the prisoned powers have burst into
intensest activity. Quiet breezes have become furious tempests.
Look around this flaming globe&mdash;on fire above, below,
around&mdash;there is nothing but fire. Let it roll beneath us
till Boston comes round again. No ember has yet cooled, no spire
of flame has shortened, no surging cloud has been quieted. Not
only are the mountains still in flame, but other ranges burst up
out of the seething sea. There is no place of rest, no place not
tossing with raging flame! Yet all this is only a feeble figure
of the great burning sun. It is but the merest hint, a million
times too insignificant.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The sun appears small and quiet to us because we are so far away.
Seen from the various planets, the relative size of the sun appears
as in Fig. 30. Looked for from some of the stars about us, the
sun could not be seen at all. Indeed, seen from the earth, it is
not always the same size, because the distance is not always the
same. If we represent the size of the sun by one thousand on the
23d of September or 21st of March, it would be represented by nine
hundred and sixty-seven on the 1st of July, and by one thousand
and thirty-four on the 1st of January.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We sometimes speak of the sun as having a diameter of 860,000 miles.
We mean that that is the extent of the body as soon by the eye.
But that is a small part of its real diameter. So we say the earth
has an equatorial diameter of 7925-1/2 miles, and a polar one of
7899. But the air is as much a part of the earth as the rocks are.
The electric currents are as much a part of the
<a name="page 79"><span class="page">Page 79</span></a>
earth as the ores and mountains they traverse. What the diameter
of the earth is, including these, no man can tell. We used to say
the air extended forty-five miles, but we now know that it reaches
vastly farther. So of the sun, we might almost say that its diameter

is infinite, for its light and heat reach beyond our measurement.
Its living, throbbing heart sends out pulsations, keeping all space
full of its tides of living light.

We might say with evident truth that the far-off planets are a
part of the sun, since the space they traverse is filled with the
power of that controlling king; not only with light, but also with
gravitating power.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But come to more ponderable matters. If we look
<a name="page 81"><span class="page">Page 81</span></a>
into our western sky soon after sunset, on a clear, moonless night
in March or April, we shall see a dim, soft light, somewhat like
the milky-way, often reaching, well defined, to the Pleiades. It
is wedge-shaped, inclined to the south, and the smallest star can
easily be seen through it. Mairan and Cassini affirm that they
have seen sudden sparkles and movements of light in it. All our
best tests show the spectrum of this light to be continuous, and
therefore reflected; which indicates that it is a ring of small
masses of meteoric matter surrounding the sun, revolving with it
and reflecting its light. One bit of stone as large as the end
of one's thumb, in a cubic mile, would be enough to reflect what
light we see looking through millions of miles of it. Perhaps an
eye sufficiently keen and far away would see the sun surrounded
by a luminous disk, as Saturn is with his rings. As it extends
beyond the earth's orbit, if this be measured as a part of the sun,
its diameter would be about 200,000,000 miles.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Come closer. When the sun is covered by the disk of the moon at
the instant of total eclipse, observers are startled by strange
swaying luminous banners, ghostly and weird, shooting in changeful
play about the central darkness (Fig. 32). These form the corona.
Men have usually been too much moved to describe them, and have
always been incapable of drawing them in the short minute or two
of their continuance. But in 1878 men travelled eight thousand
miles, coming and returning, in order that they might note the
three minutes of total eclipse in Colorado. Each man had his work
assigned to him, and he was drilled to attend to that and nothing
else. Improved instruments were put into his
<a name="page 82"><span class="page">Page 82</span></a>
hands, so that the sun was made to do his own drawing and give
his own picture at consecutive instants. Fig. 33 is a copy of a
photograph of the corona of 1878, by Mr. Henry Draper. It showed
much less changeability that year than common, it being very near
the time of least sun-spot. The previous picture was taken near
the time of maximum sun-spot.

<p class="indent">
It was then settled that the corona consists of reflected light,
sent to us from dust particles or meteoroids swirling in the vast
seas, giving new densities and
<a name="page 83"><span class="page">Page 83</span></a>
rarities, and hence this changeful light. Whether they are there
by constant projection, and fall again to the sun, or are held
by electric influence, or by force of orbital revolution, we do
not know. That the corona cannot be in any sense an atmosphere
of any continuous gas, is seen from the fact that the comet of
1843, passing within 93,000 miles of the body of the sun, was not
burned out of existence as a comet, nor in any perceptible degree
retarded in its motion. If the sun's diameter is to include the
corona, it will be from 1,260,000 to 1,460,000 miles.

Come closer still. At the instant of the totality of the eclipse
red flames of most fantastic shape play along the edge of the moon's
disk. They can be seen at any time by the use of a proper telescope
with a spectroscope attached. I have seen them with great distinctness
and brilliancy with the excellent eleven-inch telescope of the
Wesleyan University. A description of their appearance is best
given in the language of Professor Young, of Princeton College,
who has made these flames the object of most successful study.
On September 7th, 1871, he was observing a large hydrogen cloud
by the sun's edge. This cloud was about 100,000 miles long, and
its upper side was some 50,000 miles above the sun's surface, the
lower side some 15,000 miles. The whole had the appearance of being
supported on pillars of fire, these seeming pillars being in reality
hydrogen jets brighter and more active than the substance of the
cloud. At half-past twelve, when Professor Young chanced to be
called away from his observatory, there were no indications of
any approaching change, except that one of the connecting stems of
the southern extremity of the cloud had grown considerably brighter
and more curiously bent to one side; and near the base of another,
at the northern end, a little brilliant lump had developed itself,
shaped much like a summer thunderhead.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But when Professor Young returned, about half an hour later, he
found that a very wonderful change had taken place, and that a
very remarkable process was actually in progress. "The whole thing
had been literally blown to shreds," he says, "by some inconceivable
uprush from beneath. In place of the quiet cloud I had

<a name="page 87"><span class="page">Page 87</span></a>
left, the air&mdash;if I may use the expression&mdash;was filled
with the flying <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, a mass of detached vertical
fusi-form fragments, each from ten to thirty seconds (<i>i. e.</i>,
from four thousand five hundred to thirteen thousand five hundred
miles) long, by two or three seconds (nine hundred to thirteen
hundred and fifty miles) wide&mdash;brighter, and closer together
where the pillars had formerly stood, and rapidly ascending. When
I looked, some of them had already reached a height of nearly four
minutes (100,000 miles); and while I watched them they arose with
a motion almost perceptible to the eye, until, in ten minutes, the
uppermost were more than 200,000 miles above the solar surface.
This was ascertained by careful measurements, the mean of three
closely accordant determinations giving 210,000 miles as the extreme
altitude attained. I am particular in the statement, because, so far
as I know, chromatospheric matter (red hydrogen in this case) has
never before been observed at any altitude exceeding five minutes,
or 135,000 miles. The velocity of ascent, also&mdash;one hundred
and sixty-seven miles per second&mdash;is considerably greater than
anything hitherto recorded. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* As the filaments arose,
they gradually faded away like a dissolving cloud, and at a quarter
past one only a few filmy wisps, with some brighter streamers low
down near the chromatosphere, remained to mark the place. But in
the mean while the little 'thunder-head' before alluded to had grown
and developed wonderfully into a mass of rolling and ever-changing
flame, to speak according to appearances. First, it was crowded
down, as it were, along the solar surface; later, it arose almost
pyramidally 50,000 miles in height; then
<a name="page 88"><span class="page">Page 88</span></a>
its summit was drawn down into long filaments and threads, which
were most curiously rolled backward and forward, like the volutes
of an Ionic capital, and finally faded away, and by half-past two
had vanished like the other. The whole phenomenon suggested most
forcibly the idea of an explosion under the great prominence, acting
mainly upward, but also in all directions outward; and then, after
an interval, followed by a corresponding in-rush."
</p>

<p class="indent">
No language can convey nor mind conceive an idea of the fierce
commotion we here contemplate. If we call these movements hurricanes,
we must remember that what we use as a figure moves but one hundred
miles an hour, while these move one hundred miles a second. Such
storms of fire on earth, "coming down upon us from the north, would,
in thirty seconds after they had crossed the St. Lawrence, be in
the Gulf of Mexico, carrying with them the whole surface of the
continent in a mass not simply of ruins but of glowing vapor, in
which the vapors arising from the dissolution of the materials
composing the cities of Boston, New York, and Chicago would be
mixed in a single indistinguishable cloud." In the presence of
these evident visions of an actual body in furious flame, we need
hesitate no longer in accepting as true the words of St. Peter
of the time "in which the [atmospheric] heavens shall pass away
with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat;
the earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burned
up."
</p>

<p class="indent">
This region of discontinuous flame below the corona is called the
chromosphere. Hydrogen is the principal material of its upper part;
iron, magnesium, and other
<a name="page 89"><span class="page">Page 89</span></a>
metals, some of them as yet unknown on earth, but having a record
in the spectrum, in the denser parts below. If these fierce fires
are a part of the Sun, as they assuredly are, its diameter would
be from 1,060,000 to 1,260,000 miles.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Let us approach even nearer. We see a clearly recognized even disk,
of equal dimensions in every direction. This is the photosphere.
We here reach some definitely measurable data for estimating its
visible size. We already know its distance. Its disk subtends an
angle of 32' 12".6, or a little more than half a degree. Three
hundred and sixty such suns, laid side by side, would span the
celestial arch from east to west with a half circle of light. Two
lines drawn from our earth at the angle mentioned would be 860,000
miles apart at the distance of 92,500,000 miles. This, then, is
the diameter of the visible and measurable part of the sun. It
would require one hundred and eight globes like the earth in a line
to measure the sun's diameter, and three hundred and thirty-nine,
to be strung like the beads of a necklace, to encircle his waist.
The sun has a volume equal to 1,245,000 earths, but being only
one-quarter as dense, it has a mass of only 326,800 earths. It
has seven hundred times the mass of all the planets, asteroids,
and satellites put together. Thus it is able to control them all
by its greater power of attraction.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Concerning the condition of the surface of the sun many opinions
are held. That it is hot beyond all estimate is indubitable. Whether
solid or gaseous we are not sure. Opinions differ: some incline to
the first theory, others to the second; some deem the sun composed
of solid particles, floating in gas so condensed
<a name="page 90"><span class="page">Page 90</span></a>
by pressure and attraction as to shine like a solid. It has no
sensible changes of general level, but has prodigious activity
in spots. These spots have been the objects of earnest and almost
hourly study on the part of such men as Secchi, Lockyer, Faye,
Young, and others, for years. But it is a long way off to study an
object. No telescope brings it nearer than 200,000 miles. Theory
after theory has been advanced, each one satisfactory in some points,
none in all. The facts about the spots are these: They are most
abundant on the two sides of the equator. They are gregarious,
depressed below the surface, of vast extent, black in the centre,
usually surrounded by a region of partial darkness, beyond which
is excessive light. They have motion of their own over the
surface&mdash;motion rotating about an axis, upward and downward
about the edges. They change their apparent shape as the sun carries
them across its disk by axial revolution, being narrow as they
present their edges to us, and rounder as we look perpendicularly
into them (Fig. 35).

</div>

<p class="indent">
These spots are also very variable in number, sometimes there being
none for nearly two hundred days, and again whole years during which
the sun is never without them. The period from minimum to maximum
<a name="page 91"><span class="page">Page 91</span></a>
of spots is about eleven years. We might look for them again and
again in vain this year (1878). They will be most numerous in 1882
and 1893. The cause of this periodicity was inferred to be the near
approach of the enormous planet Jupiter, causing disturbance by
its attraction. But the periods do not correspond, and the cause
is the result of some law of solar action to us as yet unknown.
</p>

<p class="indent">
These spots may be seen with almost any telescope, the eye being
protected by deeply colored glasses.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Until within one hundred years they were supposed to be islands
of scori&aelig; floating in the sea of molten matter. But they
were depressed below the surface, and showed a notch when on the
edge. Wilson originated and Herschel developed the theory that
the sun's real body was dark, cool, and habitable, and that the
photosphere was a luminous stratum at a distance from the real
body, with openings showing the dark spots below. Such a sun would
have cooled off in a week, but would previously have annihilated
all life below.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The solar spots being most abundant on the two sides of the equator,
indicates their cyclonic character; the centre of a cyclone is
rarefied, and therefore colder, and cold on the sun is darkness.
M. Faye says: "Like our cyclones, they are descending, as I have
proved by a special study of these terrestrial phenomena. They
carry down into the depths of the solar mass the cooler materials
of the upper layers, formed principally of hydrogen, and thus produce
in their centre a decided extinction of light and heat as long as
the gyratory movement continues. Finally, the hydrogen set free
at the base of the whirlpool becomes reheated at this
<a name="page 92"><span class="page">Page 92</span></a>
great depth, and rises up tumultuously around the whirlpool, forming
irregular jets, which appear above the chromosphere. These jets
constitute the protuberances. The whirlpools of the sun, like those
on the earth, are of all dimensions, from the scarcely visible
pores to the enormous spots which we see from time to time. They
have, like those of the earth, a marked tendency, first to increase
and then to break up, and thus form a row of spots extending along
the same parallel."

Fig. 36.&mdash;Solar spot, by Langley.
</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">
A spot of 20,000 miles diameter is quite small; there was one 14,816
miles across, visible to the naked eye for a week in 1843. This
particular sun-spot somewhat
<a name="page 93"><span class="page">Page 93</span></a>
helped the Millerites. On the day of the eclipse, in 1858, a spot
over 107,000 miles in extent was clearly seen. In such vast tempests,
if there were ships built as large as the whole earth, they would
be tossed like autumn leaves in an ocean storm.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The revolution of the sun carries a spot across its face in about
fourteen days. After a lapse of as much more time, they often reappear
on the other side, changed but recognizable. They often break ont
or disappear under the eye of the observer. They divide like a
piece of ice dropped on a frozen pond, the pieces sliding off in
every direction, or combine like separate floes driven together
into a pack. Sometimes a spot will last for more than two hundred
days, recognizable through six or eight revolutions. Sometimes
a spot will last only half an hour.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The velocities indicated by these movements are incredible. An
up-rush and down-rush at the sides has been measured of twenty
miles a second; a side-rush or whirl, of one hundred and twenty
miles a second. These tempests rage from a few days to half a year,
traversing regions so wide that our Indian Ocean, the realm of
storms, is too small to be used for comparison; then, as they cease,
the advancing sides of the spots approach each other at the rate of
20,000 miles an hour; they strike together, and the rising spray
of fire leaps thousands of miles into space. It falls again into the
incandescent surge, rolls over mountains as the sea over pebbles, and
all this for eon after eon without sign of exhaustion or diminution.
All these swift succeeding Himalayas of fire, where one hundred
worlds could be buried, do not usually prevent the sun's appearing
to our far-off eyes as a perfect sphere.

<i>What the Sun does for us.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
To what end does this enormous power, this central source of power,
exist? That it could keep all these gigantic forces within itself
could not be expected. It is in a system where every atom is made
to affect every other atom, and every world to influence every
other. The Author of all lives only to do good, to send rain on
the just and unjust, to cause his sun to rise on the evil and the
good, and to give his spirit, like a perpetually widening river,
to every man to profit withal.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The sun reaches his unrelaxing hand of gravitation to every other
world at every instant. The tendency of every world is to fly off
in a straight line. This tendency must be momentarily curbed, and
the planet held in its true curve about the sun. These giant worlds
must be perfectly handled. Their speed, amounting to seventy times
as fast as that of a rifle-ball, must be managed. Each and every
world may be said to be lifted momentarily and swung perpetually
at arm's-length by the power of the sun.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The sun warms us. It would convey but a small idea of the truth
to state how many hundreds of millions of cubic miles of ice could
be hailed at the sun every second without affecting its heat; but,
if any one has any curiosity to know, it is 287,200,000 cubic miles
of ice per second.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We journey through space which has a temperature of 200&deg; below
zero; but we live, as it were, in a conservatory, in the midst of
perpetual winter. We are roofed over by the air that treasures the
heat, floored under by strata both absorptive and retentive of heat,
<a name="page 95"><span class="page">Page 95</span></a>
and between the earth and air violets grow and grains ripen. The
sun has a strange chemical power. It kisses the cold earth, and it
blushes with flowers and matures the fruit and grain. We are feeble
creatures, and the sun gives us force. By it the light winds move
one-eighth of a mile an hour, the storm fifty miles, the hurricane
one hundred. The force is as the square of the velocity. It is by
means of the sun that the merchant's white-sailed ships are blown
safely home. So the sun carries off the miasma of the marsh, the
pollution of cities, and then sends the winds to wash and cleanse
themselves in the sea-spray. The water-falls of the earth turn
machinery, and make Lowells and Manchesters possible, because the
sun lifted all that water to the hills.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Intermingled with these currents of air are the currents of electric
power, all derived from the sun. These have shown their swiftness
and willingness to serve man. The sun's constant force displayed
on the earth is equal to 543,000,000,000 engines of 400-horse power
each, working day and night; and yet the earth receives only
1/21500000000 part of the whole force of the sun.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Besides all this, the sun, with provident care, has made and given
to us coal. This omnipotent worker has stored away in past ages
an inexhaustible reservoir of his power which man may easily mine
and direct, thus releasing himself from absorbing toil.
</p>

<p class="center">
EXPERIMENTS.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Any one may see the spots on the sun who has a spy-glass. Darken
the room and put the glass through an opening toward the sun, as
shown in Fig. 37. The eye-piece should be drawn out about half
an inch beyond
<a name="page 96"><span class="page">Page 96</span></a>
its usual focusing for distant objects. The farther it is drawn,
the nearer must we hold the screen for a perfect image.
</p>

<p class="indent">
By holding a paper near the eye-piece, the proper direction of
the instrument may be discovered without injury to the eyes. By
this means the sun can be studied from day to day, and its spots or
the transits of Mercury and Venus shown to any number of spectators.

First covering the eyes with very dark or smoked glasses, erect
a disk of pasteboard four inches in diameter between you and the
sun; close one eye; stand near it, and the whole sun is obscured.
Withdraw from it till the sun's rays just shoot over the edge of
the disk on every side. Measure the distance from the eye to the
disk. You will be able to determine the distance of the sun by
the rule of three: thus, as four inches is to 860,000 miles, so
is distance from eye to disk to distance from disk to the sun.
Take such measurements at sunrise, noon, and sunset, and see the
apparently differing sizes due to refraction.

<i>THE PLANETS, AS SEEN FROM SPACE</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
If we were to go out into space a few millions of miles from either
pole of the sun, and were endowed with wonderful keenness of vision,
we should perceive certain facts, viz: That space is frightfully
dark except when we look directly at some luminous body. There is
no air to bend the light out of its course, no clouds or other
objects to reflect it in a thousand directions. Every star is a
brilliant point, even in perpetual sunshine. The cold is frightful
beyond the endurance of our bodies. There is no sound of voice in
the absence of air, and conversation by means of vocal organs being
impossible, it must be carried on by means of mind communication.
We see below an unrevolving point on the sun that marks its pole.
Ranged round in order are the various planets, each with its axis
pointing in very nearly the same direction. All planets, except
possibly Venus, and all moons except those of Uranus and Neptune,
present their equators to the sun. The direction of orbital and
axial revolution seen from above the North Pole would be opposite
to that of the hands of a watch.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The speed of this orbital revolution must be proportioned to the
distance from the sun. The attraction of the sun varies inversely
as the square of the distance.
<a name="page 100"><span class="page">Page 100</span></a>

<span style="float: left; width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 1em;">

<br />
Fig. 38.&mdash;Orbits and Comparative Sizes of the Planets.
</span>
</span>

It holds a planet with a certain power; one twice as far off, with
one-fourth that power. This attraction must be counterbalanced by
centrifugal force; great force from great speed when attraction
is great, and small from less
<a name="page 101"><span class="page">Page 101</span></a>
speed when attractive power is diminished by distance. Hence Mercury
must go 29.5 miles per second&mdash;seventy times as fast as a
rifle-ball that goes two-fifths of a mile in a second&mdash;or
be drawn into the sun; while Neptune, seventy-five times as far
off, and hence attracted only 1/5626 as much, must be slowed down
to 3.4 miles a second to prevent its flying away from the feebler
attraction of the sun. The orbital velocity of the various planets
in miles per second is as follows:
</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" class="center">
<tr>
 <td>Mercury</td>
 <td class="br">29.55</td>
 <td>Jupiter</td>
 <td>8.06</td>
</tr><tr>
 <td>Venus</td>
 <td class="br">21.61</td>
 <td>Saturn</td>

 <td>4.20</td>
</tr><tr>
 <td>Mars</td>
 <td class="br">14.99</td>
 <td>Neptune</td>
 <td>3.36</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">
Hence, while the earth makes one revolution in its year, Mercury
has made over four revolutions, or passed through four years; the
slower Neptune has made only 1/164 of one revolution.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The time of axial revolution which determines the length of the
day varies with different planets. The periods of the four planets
nearest the sun vary only half an hour from that of the earth, while
the enormous bodies of Jupiter and Saturn revolve in ten and ten
and a quarter hours respectively. This high rate of speed, and its
resultant, centrifugal force, has aided in preventing these bodies
from becoming as dense as they would otherwise be&mdash;Jupiter
being only 0.24 as dense as the earth, and Saturn only 0.13. This
extremely rapid revolution produces a great flattening at the poles.
If Jupiter should rotate four times more rapidly than it does, it
could not be held together compactly. As it is, the polar diameter
is five thousand miles less than the equatorial: the difference
in diameters produced by the
<a name="page 102"><span class="page">Page 102</span></a>
same cause on the earth, owing to the slower motion and smaller
mass, being only twenty-six miles. The effect of this will be more
specifically treated hereafter.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The difference in the size of the planets is very noticeable. If
we represent the sun by a gilded globe two feet in diameter, we
must represent Vulcan and Mercury by mustard-seeds; Venus, by a
pea; Earth, by another; Mars, by one-half the size; Asteroids, by
the motes in a sunbeam; Jupiter, by a small-sized orange; Saturn,
by a smaller one; Uranus, by a cherry; and Neptune, by one a little
larger.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Apply the principle that attraction is in proportion to the mass,
and a man who weighs one hundred and fifty pounds on the earth
weighs three hundred and ninety-six on Jupiter, and only fifty-eight
on Mars; while on the Asteroids he could play with bowlders for
marbles, hurl hills like Milton's angels, leap into the fifth-story
windows with ease, tumble over precipices without harm, and go
around the little worlds in seven jumps.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The seasons of a planet are caused by the inclination of its axis
to the plane of its orbit. In Fig. 39 the rotating earth is seen
at A, with its northern pole turning in constant sunlight, and
its southern pole in constant darkness; everywhere south of the
equator is more darkness than day, and hence winter. Passing on
to B, the world is seen illuminated equally on each side of the
equator. Every place has its twelve hours' darkness and light at each
revolution. But at C&mdash;the axis of the earth always preserving
the same direction&mdash;the northern pole is shrouded in continual
gloom. Every place

<span style="float: left; width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 1em;">
<a name="page 103"><span class="page">Page 103</span></a>

Fig. 39.&mdash;Orbit of Earth, showing Parallelism of Axis and Seasons.
</span>
</span>

<a name="page 105"><span class="page">Page 105</span></a>
north of the equator gets more darkness than light, and hence winter.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The varying inclination of the axes of the different planets gives
a wonderful variety to their seasons. The sun is always nearly
over the equator of Jupiter, and every place has nearly its five
hours day and five hours night. The seasons of Earth, Mars, and
Saturn are so much alike, except in length, that no comment is
necessary. The ice-fields at either pole of Mars are observed to
enlarge and contract, according as it is winter or summer there.
Saturn's seasons are each seven and a half years long. The alternate
darkness and light at the poles is fifteen years long.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the seasons of Venus present the greatest anomaly, if its assigned
inclination of axis (75&deg;) can be relied on as correct, which
is doubtful. Its tropic zone extends nearly to the pole, and at
the same time the winter at the other pole reaches the equator.
The short period of this planet causes it to present the south
pole to the sun only one hundred and twelve days after it has been
scorching the one at the north. This gives two winters, springs,
summers, and autumns to the equator in two hundred and twenty-five
days.
</p>

<p class="indent">
If each whirling world should leave behind it a trail of light to
mark its orbit, and our perceptions of form were sufficiently acute,
we should see that these curves of light are not exact circles, but
a little flattened into an ellipse, with the sun always in one
of the foci. Hence each planet is nearer to the sun at one part
of its orbit than another; that point is called the perihelion,
and the farthest point aphelion. This eccentricity of orbit, or
distance of the sun from the centre, is very small.
<a name="page 106"><span class="page">Page 106</span></a>
In the case of Venus it is only .007 of the whole, and in no instance
is it more than .2, viz., that of Mercury. This makes the sun appear
twice as large, bright, and hot as seen and felt on Mercury at
its perihelion than at its aphelion. The earth is 3,236,000 miles
nearer to the sun in our winter than summer. Hence the summer in
the southern hemisphere is more intolerable than in the northern.
But this eccentricity is steadily diminishing at a uniform rate,
by reason of the perturbing influence of the other planets. In
the case of some other planets it is steadily increasing, and, if
it were to go on a sufficient time, might cause frightful extremes
of temperature; but Lalande has shown that there are limits at
which it is said, "Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther." Then
a compensative diminution will follow.

and the other side the same distance above. Let the half-submerged
earth sail around the sun in an appropriate orbit. The surface

While quivering themselves with thunderous noises, all is silent
about them; earthquakes may be struggling on their surfaces, but
there is no hint of contention in the quiet of space. They are too
distant from one another to exchange signals, except, perhaps, the
fleet of asteroids that sail the azure between Mars and Jupiter.
Some of these come near together, continuing to fill each other's
sky for days with brightness, then one gradually draws ahead. They
have all phases for each other&mdash;crescent, half, full, and
gibbous. These hundreds of bodies fill the realm where they are
with inexhaustible variety. Beyond are vast spaces&mdash;cold,
dark, void of matter, but full of power. Occasionally a little
spark of light looms up rapidly into a world so huge that a thousand
of our earths could not occupy its vast bulk. It swings its four
or eight moons with perfect skill and infinite strength; but they
go by and leave the silence unbroken, the darkness unlighted for
years. Nevertheless, every part of space is full of power. Nowhere
in its wide orbit can a world find a place; at no time in its eons
of flight can it find an instant when the sun does not hold it
in safety and life.

<h3><i>The Outlook from the Earth.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
If we come in from our wanderings in space and take an outlook from
the earth, we shall observe certain movements, easily interpreted
now that we know the system, but nearly inexplicable to men who
naturally supposed that the earth was the largest, most stable,
and central body in the universe.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We see, first of all, sun, moon, and stars rise in the east, mount
the heavens, and set in the west. As I
<a name="page 109"><span class="page">Page 109</span></a>
revolve in my pivoted study-chair, and see all sides of the
room&mdash;library, maps, photographs, telescope, and windows&mdash;I
have no suspicion that it is the room that whirls; but looking
out of a car-window in a depot at another car, one cannot tell
which is moving, whether it be his car or the other. In regard
to the world, we have come to feel its whirl. We have noticed the
pyramids of Egypt lifted to hide the sun; the mountains of Hymettus
hurled down, so as to disclose the moon that was behind them to
the watchers on the Acropolis; and the mighty mountains of Moab
removed to reveal the stars of the east. Train the telescope on
any star; it must be moved frequently, or the world will roll the
instrument away from the object. Suspend a cannon-ball by a fine
wire at the equator; set it vibrating north and south, and it swings
all day in precisely the same direction. But suspend it directly
over the north pole, and set it swinging toward Washington; in
six hours after it is swinging toward Rome, in Italy; in twelve
hours, toward Siam, in Asia; in nineteen hours, toward the Sandwich
Islands; and in twenty-four, toward Washington again, not because
it has changed the plane of its vibration, but because the earth
has whirled beneath it, and the torsion of the wire has not been
sufficient to compel the plane of the original direction to change
with the turning of the earth. The law of inertia keeps it moving
in the same direction. The same experimental proof of revolution
is shown in a proportional degree at any point between the pole
and the equator.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the watchers on the Acropolis do not get turned over so as to
see the moon at the same time every night.
<a name="page 110"><span class="page">Page 110</span></a>
We turn down our eastern horizon, but we do not find fair Luna at
the same moment we did the night before. We are obliged to roll
on for some thirty to fifty minutes longer before we find the moon.
It must be going in the same direction, and it takes us longer to
get round to it than if if it were always in the same spot; so
we notice a star near the moon one night&mdash;it is 13&deg; west
of the moon the next night. The moon is going around the earth
from west to east, and if it goes 13&deg; in one day, it will take
a little more than twenty-seven days to go the entire circle of
360&deg;.

In our outlook we soon observe that we do not by our revolution
come to see the same stars rise at the same hour every night. Orion
and the Pleiades, our familiar friends in the winter heavens, are
gone from the summer sky. Have they fled, or are we turned from
them? This is easily understood from Fig. 42.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When the observer on the earth at A looks into the midnight sky
he sees the stars at E; but as the earth passes on to B, he sees
those stars at E three minutes sooner every night; and at midnight
the stars at F are over his head. Thus in a year, by going around
the sun, we have every star of the celestial dome in our midnight
sky. We see also how the sun appears among the successive
constellations. When we are at A, we see the sun among the stars
at G; but as we move toward B, the sun appears to move toward H.
If we had observed the sun rise on the 20th of August, 1876, we
should have seen it rise a little before Regulus, and a little
south of it, in such a relation as circle 1 is to the star in Fig.

<span style="float: left; width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 1em;">

43. By sunset the earth had moved enough to make the sun appear
to be at circle 2, and by the next morning at circle 3, at which
time Regulus would rise before the sun. Thus the earth's motion
seems to make the sun traverse a regular circle among the stars
once a year: but it is not the sun that moves.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are certain stars that have such irregular, uncertain, vagarious
ways that they were called vagabonds, or planets, by the early
astronomers. Here is the path of Jupiter in the year 1866 (Fig.
44). These bodies go forward for awhile, then stop, start aside,
then retrograde,
<a name="page 112"><span class="page">Page 112</span></a>
and go on again. Some are never seen far from the sun, and others
in all parts of the ecliptic.

First see them as they stand to-day, as in Fig. 45. The observer
stands on the earth at A. It has rolled over so far that he cannot
see the sun; it has set. But Venus is still in sight; Jupiter is
45&deg; behind Venus, and Saturn is seen 90&deg; farther east.
When A has rolled a little farther, if he is awake, he will see
Mars before he sees the sun; or, in common language, Venus will
set after, and Mars rise before the sun. All these bodies at near
and far distances seem set in the starry dome, as the different
stars seem in Fig. 42, p. 110.

The mysterious movements of advance and retreat are rendered

the earth, B is located at <i>a</i>,
<a name="page 113"><span class="page">Page 113</span></a>
on the background of the stars it seems to be among. It remains
apparently stationary at <i>a</i> for some time, because approaching
the earth in nearly a straight line. Passing D to C, it appears to
retrograde among the stars to <i>c</i>; remains apparently stationary
for some time, then, in passing from C to E and A, appears to pass back
among the stars to <i>a</i>. The progress of the earth, meanwhile,
although it greatly retards the apparent motion from A to C, greatly
hastens it from C to A.

<p class="indent">
It is also apparent that Mercury and Venus, seen from the earth,
can never appear far from the sun. They must be just behind the
sun as evening stars, or just before it as heralds of the morning.
Venus is never more than 47&deg; from the sun, and Mercury never
more than 30&deg;; indeed, it keeps so near the sun that very few
people have ever seen the brilliant sparkler. Observe how much
larger the planet appears near the earth in conjunction at D than
in opposition at E. Observe also what phases it must present, and
how transits sometimes take place.

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 114"><span class="page">Page 114</span></a>
The movement of a superior planet, one whose orbit is exterior
to the earth, is clear from Fig. 47. When the earth is at A and
Mars at B, it will appear among the stars at C. When the earth is
at D, Mars having moved more slowly to E, will have retrograded
to F. It remains there while the earth passes on, in a line nearly
straight, from Mars to G; then, as the earth begins to curve around
the sun, Mars will appear to retraverse the distance from F to
C, and beyond. The farther the superior planet is from the earth
the less will be the retrograde movement.

The reader should draw the orbits in proportion, and, remembering
the relative speed of each planet, note the movement of each in
different parts of their orbits.
</p>

<p class="indent">
To account for these most simple movements, the earlier astronomers
invented the most complex and impossible machinery. They thought the
earth the centre, and that the sun, moon, and stars were carried
about it, as stoves around a person to warm him. They thought these
strange movements of the planets were accomplished by mounting them
on subsidiary eccentric wheels in the revolving crystal sphere.
All that was
<a name="page 115"><span class="page">Page 115</span></a>
needed to give them a right conception was a sinking of their world
and themselves to an appropriate proportion, and an enlargement
of their vision, to take in from an exalted stand-point a view
of the simplicity of the perfect plan.
</p>

<p class="center">EXPERIMENTS.</p>

<p class="indent">
Fix a rod, or tube, or telescope pointing at a star in the cast
or west, and the earth's revolution will be apparent in a moment,
turning the tube away from the star. Point it at stars about the
north pole, and those on one side will be found going in an opposite
direction from those on the other, and very much slower than those
about the equator. Anyone can try the pendulum experiment who has
access to some lofty place from which to suspend the ball. It was
tried in Bunker Hill Monument a few years ago, and is to be tried
in Paris, in the summer of 1879, with a seven-hundred-pound pendulum
and a suspending wire seventy yards long. The advance and retrograde
movements of planets can be illustrated by two persons walking
around a centre and noticing the place where the person appears
projected on the wall beyond.

<p class="indent">
Before particularly considering the larger aggregations of matter
called planets or worlds as individuals, it is best to investigate
a part of the solar system consisting of smaller collections of
matter scattered everywhere through space. They are of various
densities, from a cloudlet of rarest gas to solid rock; of various
sizes, from a grain's weight to little worlds; of various relations
to each other, from independent individuality to related streams
millions of miles long. When they become visible they are called
shooting-stars, which are evanescent star-points darting through
the upper air, leaving for an instant a brilliant train; meteors,
sudden lights, having a discernible diameter, passing over a large
extent of country, often exploding with violence (Fig. 48), and
throwing down upon the earth aerolites; and comets, vast extents
of ghostly light, that come we know not whence and go we know not
whither. All these forms of matter are governed by the same laws
as the worlds, and are an integral part of the solar system&mdash;a
part of the unity of the universe.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Everyone has seen the so-called shooting-stars. They break out
with a sudden brilliancy, shoot a few degrees with quiet speed,
and are gone before we can say, "See there!" The cause of their
appearance, the
<a name="page 120"><span class="page">Page 120</span></a>
conversion of force into heat by their contact with our atmosphere,
has been already explained. Other facts remain to be studied. They
are found to appear about seventy-three miles above the earth, and

</span>

to disappear about twenty miles nearer the surface. Their average
velocity, thirty-five, sometimes rises to one hundred miles a second.
They exhibit different colors, according to their different chemical
substances, which are consumed. The number of them to be seen on
different nights is exceedingly variable; sometimes not more
<a name="page 121"><span class="page">Page 121</span></a>
than five or six an hour, and sometimes so many that a man cannot
count those appearing in a small section of sky. This variability is
found to be periodic. There are everywhere in space little meteoric
masses of matter, from the weight of a grain to a ton, and from the
density of gas to rock. The earth meets 7,500,000 little bodies
every day&mdash;there is collision&mdash;the little meteoroid gives
out its lightning sign of extinction, and, consumed in fervent heat,
drops to the earth as gas or dust. If we add the number light enough
to be seen by a telescope, they cannot be less than 400,000,000
a day. Everywhere we go, in a space as large as that occupied by
the earth and its atmosphere, there must be at least 13,000
bodies&mdash;one in 20,000,000 cubic miles&mdash;large enough to
make a light visible to the naked eye, and forty times that number
capable of revealing themselves to telescopic vision. Professor
Peirce is about to publish, as the startling result of his
investigations, "that the heat which the earth receives directly
from meteors is the same in amount which it receives from the sun
by radiation, and that the sun receives five-sixths of its heat
from the meteors that fall upon it."

In 1783 Dr. Schmidt was fortunate enough to have a telescopic view
of a system of bodies which had turned into meteors. These were two
larger bodies followed by several smaller ones, going in parallel
lines till they were extinguished. They probably had been revolving
about each other as worlds and satellites before entering our
atmosphere. It is more than probable that the earth has many such
bodies, too small to be visible, revolving around it as moons.

Their velocity has been lessened by the resisting air, and the
excessive heat diminished. Still, if found soon after their descent,
they are too hot to be handled. These are called aerolites or
air-stones. There was a fall in Iowa, in February, 1875, from which
fragments amounting to five hundred pounds weight were secured. On
the evening of December 21st, 1876, a meteor of unusual size and
brilliancy passed over the states of Kansas, Missouri, Illinois,
Indiana, and Ohio. It was first seen in the western part of Kansas,
at an altitude of about sixty miles. In crossing the State of Missouri
it began to explode, and this breaking up continued while passing
Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, till it consisted of a large flock
of brilliant balls chasing each other across the sky, the number
being variously estimated at from twenty to one hundred. It was
accompanied by terrific explosions, and was seen along a path of
not less than a thousand miles. When first seen in Kansas, it is
said to have appeared as large as the full moon, and with a train
from twenty-five to one hundred feet long. Another, very similar in
appearance and behavior, passed over a part of the same course in
February, 1879. At Laigle, France, on April 26th, 1803, about one
o'clock in the day, from two to three thousand fell. The largest did
not exceed seventeen pounds weight. One fell in Weston, Connecticut,
in 1807, weighing two hundred pounds. A very destructive shower is
mentioned in the book of Joshua, chap. x. ver. 11.

These bodies are not evenly distributed through space. In some
places they are gathered into systems which circle round the sun

them and the giant Jupiter by the same power. The Power that cares
for a world cares for a sparrow. If their orbit so lies that a
planet passes through it, and the planet and the meteors are at the
point of intersection at the same time, there must be collisions,
and the lightning signs of extinction proportioned to the number
of little bodies in a given space.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is demonstrated that the earth encounters more than one hundred
such systems of meteoric bodies in a single year. It passes through
one on the 10th of August, another on the 11th of November. In
a certain part of the first there is an agglomeration of bodies
sufficient to become visible as it approaches the sun, and this is
known as the comet of 1862; in the second is a similar agglomeration,
known as Temple's comet. It is repeating the same thing to say that
meteoroids follow in the train of the comets. The probable orbit
of the November meteors and the comet of 1866 is an exceedingly
elongated ellipse, embracing the orbit of the earth at one end and
a portion of the orbit of Uranus at the other (Fig. 51). That of
the August meteors and the comet of 1862 embraces the orbit of
the earth at one end, and thirty per cent. of the other end is
beyond the orbit of Neptune.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In January, 1846, Biela's comet was observed to be divided. At
its next return, in 1852, the parts were 1,500,000 miles apart.
They could not be found on their periodic returns in 1859, 1865,
and 1872; but it
<a name="page 125"><span class="page">Page 125</span></a>
should have crossed the earth's orbit early in September, 1872.
The earth itself would arrive at the point of crossing two or three
months later. If the law of revolution held, we might still expect
to find some of the trailing meteoroids of the comet not gone by on

our arrival. It was shown that the point of the earth that would
strike them would be toward a certain place in the constellation of
Andromeda, if the remains of the diluted comet were still there.
The prediction was verified in every respect. At the appointed
time, place,
<a name="page 126"><span class="page">Page 126</span></a>
and direction, the streaming lights were in our sky. That these
little bodies belonged to the original comet none can doubt. By
the perturbations of planetary attraction, or by different original
velocities, a comet may be lengthened into an invisible stream, or
an invisible stream agglomerated till it is visible as a comet.
</p>

<h3><i>Comets.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
Comets will be most easily understood by the foregoing considerations.
They are often treated as if they were no part of the solar system;
but they are under the control of the same laws, and owe their
existence, motion, and continuance to the same causes as Jupiter and
the rest of the planets. They are really planets of wider wandering,
greater ellipticity, and less density. They have periodic times
less than the earth, and fifty times as great as Neptune. They
are little clouds of gas or meteoric matter, or both, darting into
the solar system from every side, at every angle with the plane
of the ecliptic, becoming luminous with reflected light, passing
the sun, and returning again to outer darkness. Sometimes they
have no tail, having a nucleus surrounded by nebulosity like a
dim sun with zodiacal light; sometimes one tail, sometimes half a
dozen. These follow the comet to perihelion, and precede it afterward
(Fig. 52). The orbits of some comets are enormously elongated; one
end may lie inside the earth's orbit, and the other end be as far
beyond Neptune as that is from the sun. Of course only a small
part of such a curve can be studied by us: the comet is visible
only when near the sun. The same curve around the sun may be an
orbit that will bring it back again,

<span style="float: left; width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 1em;">
<a name="page 127"><span class="page">Page 127</span></a>
<span style="font-size: smaller;">
<img src="images/fig52.jpg" width="533" height="531" alt="Figure 52">
<br />
Fig. 52.&mdash;Aspects of Remarkable Comets.
</span>
</span>

or one that will carry it off into infinite space, never to return.
One rate of speed on the curve indicates an elliptical orbit that
returns; a greater rate of speed indicates that it will take a
parabolic orbit, which never returns. The exact rate of speed is
exceedingly difficult to determine; hence it cannot be confidently
asserted that any comet ever visible will not return. They may
all belong to the solar system; but some will certainly be gone
thousands of years before their fiery forms will greet the watchful
eyes of dwellers on the earth. A comet that has an elliptic orbit
may have it changed to
<a name="page 128"><span class="page">Page 128</span></a>
parabolic by the accelerations of its speed, by attracting planets;
or a parabolic comet may become elliptic, and so permanently attracted
to the system by the retardations of attracting bodies. A comet of
long period may be changed to one of short period by such attraction,
or <i>vice versa</i>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The number of comets, like that of meteor streams, is exceedingly
large. Five hundred have been visible to the naked eye since the
Christian era. Two hundred have been seen by telescopes invented
since their invention. Some authorities estimate the number belonging
to our solar system by millions; Professor Peirce says more than
five thousand millions.
</p>

<h3><i>Famous Comets.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
The comet of 1680 is perhaps the one that appeared in A.D. 44,
soon after the death of Julius C&aelig;sar, also in the reign of
Justinian, A.D. 531, and in 1106. This is not determined by any
recognizable resemblance. It had a tail 70&deg; long; it was not
all arisen when its head reached the meridian. It is possible,
from the shape of its orbit, that it has a periodic time of nine
thousand years, or that it may have a parabolic orbit, and never
return. Observations taken two hundred years ago have not the exactness
necessary to determine so delicate a point.
</p>

<p class="indent">
On August 19th, 1682, Halley discovered a comet which he soon declared
to be one seen by Kepler in 1607. Looking back still farther, he
found that a comet was seen in 1531 having the same orbit. Still
farther, by the same exact period of seventy-five years, he found
that it was the same comet that had disturbed
<a name="page 129"><span class="page">Page 129</span></a>
the equanimity of Pope Calixtus in 1456. Calculations were undertaken
as to the result of all the accelerations and retardations by the
attractions of all the planets for the next seventy-five years.
There was not time to finish all the work; but a retardation of
six hundred and eighteen days was determined, with a possible error
of thirty days. The comet actually came to time within thirty-three
days, on March 12th, 1759. Again its return was calculated with
more laborious care. It came to time and passed the sun within
three days of the predicted time, on the 16th of November, 1835.
It passed from sight of the most powerful telescopes the following
May, and has never since been seen by human eye. But the eye of
science sees it as having passed its aphelion beyond the orbit
of Neptune in 1873, and is already hastening back to the warmth
and light of the sun. It will be looked for in 1911; and there
is good hope of predicting, long before it is seen, the time of
its perihelion within a day.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Biela's lost Comet.</i>&mdash;This was a comet with a periodic
time of six years and eight months. It was observed in January,
1846, to have separated into two parts of unequal brightness. The
lesser part grew for a month until it equalled the other, then
became smaller and disappeared, while the other was visible a month
longer. At disappearance the parts were 200,000 miles asunder. On
its next return, in 1852, the parts were 1,500,000 miles apart;
sometimes one was brighter and sometimes the other; which was the
fragment and which was the main body could not be recognized. They
vanished in September, 1852, and have never been seen since. Three
revolutions have been made since that time, but no
<a name="page 130"><span class="page">Page 130</span></a>
trace of it could be discovered. Probably the same influence that
separated it into parts, separated the particles till too thin
and tenuous to be seen. There is ground for believing that the
earth passed through a part of it, as before stated under the head
of meteors.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>The Great Comet of</i> 1843 passed nearer the sun than any known
body. It almost grazed the sun. If it ever returns, it will be in
A.D. 2373.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Donati's Comet of</i> 1858.&mdash;This was one of the most
magnificent of modern times. During the first three months it showed
no tail, but from August to October it had developed one forty
degrees in length. Its period is about two thousand years. Every
reader remembers the comet of the summer of 1875.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Encke's Comet.</i>&mdash;This comet has become famous for its
supposed confirmation of the theory that space was filled with a
substance infinitely tenuous, which resisted the passage of this
gaseous body in an appreciable degree, and in long ages would so
retard the motion of all the planets that gravitation would draw
them all one by one into the sun. We must not be misled by the
term retardation to suppose it means behind time, for a retarded
body is before time. If its velocity is diminished, the attraction
of the sun causes it to take a smaller orbit, and smaller orbits
mean increased speed&mdash;hence the supposed retardation would
shorten its periodic time. This comet was thought to be retarded
two and a half hours at each revolution. If it was, it would not
prove the existence of the resisting medium. Other causes, unknown
to us, might account for it. Subsequent and more exact calculations
fail to find any retardations in at least two revolutions between
1865 and
<a name="page 131"><span class="page">Page 131</span></a>
1871. Indications point to a retardation of one and a half hours
both before and since. But such discrepancy of result proves nothing
concerning a resisting medium, but rather is an argument against
its existence. Besides, Faye's comet, in four revolutions of seven
years each, shows no sign of retardation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The truth may be this, that a kind of atmosphere exists around the
sun, perhaps revealed by the zodiacal light, that reaches beyond
where Encke's comet dips inside the orbit of Mercury, and thus
retards this body, but does not reach beyond the orbit of Mars,
where Faye's comet wheels and withdraws.
</p>

<h3><i>Of what do Comets consist?</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
The unsolved problems pertaining to comets are very numerous and
exceedingly delicate. Whence come they? Why did they not contract
to centres of nebul&aelig;? Are there regions where attractions
are balanced, and matter is left to contract on itself, till the
movements of suns and planets adds or diminishes attractive force on
one side, and so allows them to be drawn slowly toward one planet,
and its sun, or another? There is ground for thinking that the comet
of 1866 and its train of meteors, visible to us in November, was
thus drawn into our system by the planet Uranus. Indeed, Leverrier
has conjecturally fixed upon the date of A.D. 128 as the time when
it occurred; but another and closer observation of its next return,
in 1899, will be needed to give confirmation to the opinion. Our
sun's authority extends at least half-way to the nearest fixed star,
one hundred thousand times farther than the orbit of the earth.
Meteoric and cometary matter lying
<a name="page 132"><span class="page">Page 132</span></a>
there, in a spherical shell about the solar system, balanced between
the attraction of different suns, finally feels the power that
determines its destiny toward our sun. It would take 167,000,000
years to come thence to our system.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The conditions of matter with which we are acquainted do not cover
all the ground presented by these mysterious visitors. We know
a gas sixteen times as light as air, but hydrogen is vastly too
heavy and dense; for we see the faintest star through thousands of
miles of cometary matter; we know that water may become cloudy vapor,
but a little of it obscures the vision. Into what more ethereal,
and we might almost say spiritual, forms matter may be changed we
cannot tell. But if we conceive comets to be only gas, it would
expand indefinitely in the realms of space, where there is no force
of compression but its own. We might say that comets are composed
of small separate masses of matter, hundreds of miles apart; and,
looking through thousands of miles of them, we see light enough
reflected from them all to seem continuous. Doubtless that is sometimes
the case. But the spectroscope shows another state of things: it
reveals in some of these comets an incandescent gas&mdash;usually
some of the combinations of carbon. The conclusion, then, naturally
is that there are both gas and small masses of matter, each with an
orbit of its own nearly parallel to those of all the others, and
that they afford some attraction to hold the mass of intermingled and
confluent gas together. Our best judgment, then, is that the nucleus
is composed of separate bodies, or matter in a liquid condition,
capable of being vaporized by the heat of the sun, and driven off,
<a name="page 133"><span class="page">Page 133</span></a>
as steam from a locomotive, into a tail. Indications of this are
found in the fact that tails grow smaller at successive returns, as
the matter capable of such vaporization becomes condensed. In some
instances, as in that of the comet of 1843, the head was diminished
by the manufacture of a tail. On the other hand, Professor Peirce
showed that the nucleus of the comets of 1680, 1843, and 1858 must
have had a tenacity equal to steel, to prevent being pulled apart
by the tidal forces caused by its terrible perihelion sweep around
the sun.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is likely that there are great varieties of condition in different
comets, and in the same comet at times. We see them but a few days
out of the possible millions of their periodic time; we see them
only close to the sun, under the spur of its tremendous attraction
and terrible heat. This gives us ample knowledge of the path of
their orbit and time of their revolution, but little ground for
judgment of their condition, when they slowly round the uttermost
cape of their far-voyaging, in the terrible cold and darkness,
to commence their homeward flight. The unsolved problems are not
all in the distant sun and more distant stars, but one of them
is carried by us, sometimes near, sometimes far off; but our
acquaintance with the possible forms and conditions of matter is
too limited to enable us to master the difficulties.
</p>

<h3><i>Will Comets strike the Earth?</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
Very likely, since one or two have done so within a recent period.
What will be the effect? That depends on circumstances. There is
good reason to suppose we passed through the tail of a comet in
1861, and the only
<a name="page 134"><span class="page">Page 134</span></a>
observable effect was a peculiar phosphorescent mist. If the comet
were composed of small meteoric masses a brilliant shower would
be the result. But if we fairly encountered a nucleus of any
considerable mass and solidity, the result would be far more serious.
The mass of Donati's comet has been estimated by M. Faye to be
1/20000 of that of the earth. If this amount of matter were dense
as water, it would make a globe five hundred miles in diameter;
and if as dense as Professor Peirce proved the nucleus of this
comet to be, its impact with the earth would develop heat enough
to melt and vaporize the hardest rocks. Happily there is little
fear of this: as Professor Newcomb says, "So small is the earth
in comparison with celestial space, that if one were to shut his
eyes and fire at random in the air, the chance of bringing down a
bird would be better than that of a comet of any kind striking the
earth." Besides, we are not living under a government of chance,
but under that of an Almighty Father, who upholdeth all things
by the word of his power; and no world can come to ruin till he
sees that it is best.

How many bodies there may be revolving about the sun we have no
means to determine or arithmetic to express. When the new star
of the American Republic appeared, there were but six planets
discovered. Since then three regions of the solar system have been
explored with wonderful success. The outlying realms beyond Saturn
yielded the planet Uranus in 1781, and Neptune in 1846. The middle
region between Jupiter and Mars yielded the little planetoid Ceres
in 1801, Pallas in 1802, and one hundred and ninety others since.
The inner region between Mercury and the sun is of necessity full
of small meteoric bodies; the question is, are there any bodies
large enough to be seen?
</p>

<p class="indent">
The same great genius of Leverrier that gave us Neptune from the
observed perturbations of Uranus, pointed out perturbations in
Mercury that necessitated either a planet or a group of planetoids
between Mercury and the sun. Theoretical astronomers, aided by the
fact that no planet had certainly been seen, and that all asserted
discoveries of one had been by inexperienced observers, inclined
to the belief in a group, or that the disturbance was caused by
the matter reflecting the zodiacal light.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When the total eclipse of the sun occurred in 1878,
<a name="page 138"><span class="page">Page 138</span></a>
astronomers were determined that the question of the existence
of an intra-mercurial planet should be settled. Maps of all the
stars in the region of the sun were carefully studied, sections
of the sky about the sun were assigned to different observers,
who should attend to nothing but to look for a possible planet.
It is now conceded that Professor Watson, of Ann Arbor, actually
saw the sought-for body.

Mercury shines with a white light nearly as bright as Sirius; is
always near the horizon. When nearly between us and the sun, as
at D (Fig. 46, p. 113), its illuminated side nearly opposite to
us, we, looking from E, see only a thin crescent of its light.
When it is at its greatest angular distance from the sun, as A or
C, we see it illuminated like the half-moon. When it is beyond the
sun, as at E, we see its whole illuminated face like the full-moon.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The variation of its apparent size from the varying distance is
very striking. At its extreme distance from the earth it subtends
an angle of only five seconds; nearest to us, an angle of twelve
seconds. Its distance from the earth varies nearly as one to three,
and its apparent size in the inverse ratio.

When Mercury comes between the earth and the sun, near the line
where the planes of their orbits cut each other by reason of their
inclination, the dark body of Mercury will be seen on the bright
surface of the sun. This is called a transit. If it goes across
the centre of the sun it may consume eight hours. It goes 100,000
miles an hour, and has 860,000 miles of disk to cross. The transit of
1818 occupied seven and a half hours. The transits for the remainder

This brilliant planet is often visible in the daytime. I was once
delighted by seeing Venus looking down, a little after mid-day
through the open space in the dome of the Pantheon at Rome. It
has never since seemed to me as if the home of all the gods was
deserted. Ph&oelig;bus, Diana, Venus and the rest, thronged through
that open upper door at noon of night or day. Arago relates that
Bonaparte, upon repairing to Luxemburg when the Directory was about
to give him a <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, was much surprised at seeing the
multitude paying more attention to the heavens above the palace
than to him or his brilliant staff. Upon inquiry, he learned that
these curious persons were observing with astonishment a star which
they supposed to be that of the conqueror of Italy. The emperor
himself was not indifferent when
<a name="page 140"><span class="page">Page 140</span></a>
his piercing eye caught the clear lustre of Venus smiling upon him
at mid-day.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This unusual brightness occurs when Venus is about five weeks before
or after her inferior conjunction, and also nearest overhead by
being north of the sun. This last circumstance occurs once in eight
years, and came on February 16th, 1878.

<p class="indent">
Venus may be as near the earth as 22,000,000 miles, and as far
away as 160,000,000. This variation of its distances from the earth
is obviously much greater than that of Mercury, and its consequent
apparent size much more changeable. Its greatest and least apparent
sizes are as ten and sixty-five (Fig. 53).

When Copernicus announced the true theory of the solar system, he
said that if the inferior planets could be clearly seen they would
show phases like the moon. When Galileo turned the little telescope
he had made on Venus, he confirmed the prophecy of Copernicus.
Desiring to take time for more extended observation, and still be
able to assert the priority of his discovery, he published the
following anagram, in which his discovery was contained:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
<a name="page 141"><span class="page">Page 141</span></a>
"H&aelig;c immatura a me jam frustra leguntur o. y."<br />
(These unripe things are now vainly gathered by me.)
</p>

<p>
He first saw Venus as gibbous; a few months revealed it as crescent,
and then he transposed his anagram into:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"Cynthi&aelig; figuras &aelig;mulatur mater amorum."<br />
(The mother of loves imitates the phases of Cynthia.)
</p>

<p class="indent">
Many things that were once supposed to be known concerning Venus are
not confirmed by later and better observations. Venus is surrounded
by an atmosphere so dense with clouds that it is conceded that
her time of rotation and the inclination of her axis cannot be
determined. She revealed one of the grandest secrets of the universe
to the first seeker; showed her highest beauty to her first ardent
lover, and has veiled herself from the prying eyes of later comers.

Florence has built a kind of shrine for the telescope of Galileo.

the mountains of the moon, the satellites of Jupiter, and some
irregularities of shape in Saturn, caused by its rings. Galileo
subsequently became blind, but he had used his eyes to the best
purpose of any man in his generation.

into a sphere by its own inherent attraction, so the earth gathers
itself into a ball. Noticing closely, we see forms of continents
outlined in bright relief, and oceanic forms in darker surfaces.
We see that its axis of revolution is nearly perpendicular to the
line of light from the sun. One-half is always dark. The sunrise
greets a new thousand miles every hour; the glories of
<a name="page 143"><span class="page">Page 143</span></a>
the sunset follow over an equal space, 180&deg; behind. We are glad
that the darkness never overtakes the morning.

<h3><i>The Aurora Borealis.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
While east and west are gorgeous with sunrise and sunset, the north
is often more glorious with its aurora borealis. We remember that

all worlds have weird and inexplicable appendages. They are not
limited to their solid surfaces or their circumambient air. The
sun has its fiery flames, corona, zodiacal light, and perhaps a
finer kind of atmosphere than we know. The earth is
<a name="page 144"><span class="page">Page 144</span></a>
not without its inexplicable surroundings. It has not only its
gorgeous eastern sunrise, its glorious western sunset, high above
its surface in the clouds, but it also has its more glorious northern
dawn far above its clouds and air. The realm of this royal splendor
is as yet an unconquered world waiting for its Alexander. There are
certain observable facts, viz., it prevails mostly near the arctic
circle rather than the pole; it takes on various forms&mdash;cloud-like,
arched, straight; it streams like banners, waves like curtains in
the wind, is inconstant; is either the cause or result of electric
disturbance; it is often from four hundred to six hundred miles
above the earth, while our air cannot be over one hundred miles.
It almost seems like a revelation to human eyes of those vast,
changeable, panoramic pictures by which the inhabitants of heaven
are taught.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Investigation has discovered far more mysteries than it has explained.
It is possible that the same cause that produces sun-spots produces
aurora in all space, visible in all worlds. If so, we shall see
more abundant auroras at the next maximum of sun-spot, between
1880-84.
</p>

<h3><i>The Delicate Balance of Forces.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
A soap-bubble in the wind could hardly be more flexible in form
and sensitive to influence than is the earth. On the morning of
May 9th, 1876, the earth's crust at Peru gave a few great throbs
upward, by the action of expansive gases within. The sea fled,
and returned in great waves as the land rose and fell. Then these
waves fled away over the great mobile surface, and in less than
five hours they had covered a space equal to half of Europe. The
waves ran out to the Sandwich Islands, six
<a name="page 145"><span class="page">Page 145</span></a>
thousand miles, at the rate of five hundred miles an hour, and
arrived there thirty feet high. They not only sped on in straight
radial lines, but, having run up the coast to California, were
deflected away into the former series of waves, making the most
complex undulations. Similar beats of the great heart of the earth
have sent its pulses as widely and rapidly on previous occasions.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The figure of the earth, even on the ocean, is irregular, in consequence
of the greater preponderance of land&mdash;and hence greater
density&mdash;in the northern hemisphere. These irregularities are
often very perplexing in making exact geodetic measurements. The
tendency of matter to fly from the centre by reason of revolution
causes the equatorial diameter to be twenty-six, miles longer than
the polar one. By this force the Mississippi River is enabled to
run up a hill nearly three miles high at a very rapid rate. Its
mouth is that distance farther from the centre of the earth than
its source, when but for this rotation both points would be equally
distant.
</p>

<p class="indent">
If the water became more dense, or if the world were to revolve
faster, the oceans would rush to the equator, burying the tallest
mountains and leaving polar regions bare. If the water should become
lighter in an infinitesimal degree, or the world rotate more slowly,
the poles would be submerged and the equator become an arid waste.
No balance, turning to 1/1000 of a grain, is more delicate than
the poise of forces on the world. Laplace has given us proof that
the period of the earth's axial rotation has not changed 1/100
of a second of time in two thousand years.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="page 146"><span class="page">Page 146</span></a>
<i>Tides.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
But there is an outside influence that is constantly acting upon
the earth, and to which it constantly responds. Two hundred and
forty thousand miles from the earth is the moon, having 1/81 the
mass of the world. Its attractive influence on the earth causes the
movable and nearer portions to hurry away from the more stable and
distant, and heap themselves up on that part of the earth nearest
the moon. Gravitation is inversely as the square of the distance;
hence the water on the surface of the earth is attracted more than
the body of the earth, some parts of which are eight thousand miles
farther off; hence the water rises on the side next the moon. But
the earth, as a whole, is nearer the moon than the water on the
opposite side, and being drawn more strongly, is taken away from
the water, leaving it heaped up also on the side opposite to the
moon.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A subsidiary cause of tides is found in the revolution of the earth
and moon about their common centre of gravity. Revolution about
an axis through the centre of a sphere enlarges the equator by
centrifugal force. Revolution about an axis touching the surface
of a flexible globe converts it into an egg-shaped body, with the
longer axis perpendicular to the axis of revolution. In Fig. 56 the
point of revolution is seen at the centre of gravity at G; hence,
in the revolution of earth and moon as one, a strong centrifugal
force is caused at D, and a less one at C. This gives greater height
to the tides than the attraction of the moon alone could produce.
</p>

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 1em;">
<span style="font-size: smaller;">

<img src="images/fig56.jpg" width="562" height="155" alt="Figure 56">
<br />
Fig. 56.
</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">
If the earth had no axial revolution, the attractive point where
the tide rises would be carried around the earth once in twenty-seven
days by the moon's revolution about the earth. But since the earth
revolves on its axis, it presents a new section to the moon's attraction
every hour. If the moon were stationary, that would bring two high
tides in exactly twenty-four hours; but as the moon goes forward,
we need nearly twenty-five hours for two tides.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The attractive influence of the sun also gives us a tide four-tenths
as great as that of the moon. When these two influences of the
sun and moon combine, as they do, in conjunction&mdash;when both
bodies are on one side of the earth; or in opposition, sun and
moon being on opposite sides of the earth&mdash;we have spring or
increased tides. When the moon is in its first or third quarter,
<i>i. e.</i>, when a line from the moon to the earth makes a right
angle with one from the sun to the earth, these influences antagonize
one another, and we have the neap or low tides.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is easy to see that if, when the moon was drawing its usual
tide, the sun drew four-tenths of the water in a tide at right
angles with it, the moon's tide must be by so much lower. Because
of the inertia of the water
<a name="page 148"><span class="page">Page 148</span></a>
it does not yield instantly to the moon's influence, and the crest
of the tide is some hours behind the advancing moon.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The amount of tide in various places is affected by almost innumerable
influences, as distance of moon at its apogee or perigee; its position
north, south, or at the equator; distance of earth from sun at
perihelion and aphelion; the position of islands; the trend of
continents, etc. All eastern shores have far greater tides than
western. As the earth rolls to the east it leaves the tide-crest
under the moon to impinge on eastern shores, hence the tides of
from seventy-five to one hundred feet in the Bay of Fundy. Lakes and
most seas are too small to have perceptible tides. The spring-tides
in the Mediterranean Sea are only about three inches.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This constant ebb and flow of the great sea is a grand provision for
its purification. Even the wind is sent to the sea to be cleansed.
The sea washes every shore, purifies every cove, bay, and river
twice every twenty-four hours. All putrescible matter liable to
breed a pestilence is carried far from shore and sunk under fathoms
of the never-stagnant sea. The distant moon lends its mighty power
to carry the burdens of commerce. She takes all the loads that
can be floated on her flowing tides, and cheerfully carries them
in opposite directions in successive journeys.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It must be conceded that the profoundest study has not mastered
the whole philosophy of tides. There are certain facts which are
apparent, but for an explanation of their true theory such men as
Laplace, Newton, and Airy have labored in vain. There are plenty
of other worlds still to conquer.

When the astronomer Herschel was observing the southern sky from
the Cape of Good Hope, the most clever hoax was perpetrated that
ever was palmed upon a credulous public. Some new and wonderful
instruments were carefully described as having been used by that
astronomer, whereby he was enabled to bring the moon so close that
he could see thereon trees, houses, animals, and men-like human
beings. He could even discern their movements, and gestures that
indicated a peaceful race. The extent of the hoax will be perceived
when it is stated that no telescope that we are now able to make
reveals the moon more clearly than it would appear to the naked
eye if it was one hundred or one hundred and fifty miles away.
The distance at which a man can be seen by the unaided eye varies
according to circumstances of position, background, light, and
eye, but it is much inside of five miles.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Since, however, the moon is our nearest neighbor, a member of our
own family in fact, it is a most interesting object of study.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A glance at its familiar face reveals its unequal illumination.
All ages and races have seen a man in the moon. All lovers have
sworn by its constancy, and only part of them have kept their oaths.
Every twenty-nine or thirty days we see a silver crescent in the
west, and are glad if it comes over the right shoulder&mdash;so
<a name="page 152"><span class="page">Page 152</span></a>
much tribute does habit pay to superstition. The next night it
is thirteen degrees farther east from the sun. We note the stars
it occults, or passes by, and leaves behind as it broadens its
disk, till it rises full-orbed in the east when the sun sinks in
the west. It is easy to see that the moon goes around the earth
from west to east. Afterward it rises later and smaller each night,
till at length, lost from sight, it rises about the same time as
the sun, and soon becomes the welcome crescent new moon again.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The same peculiarities are always evident in the visible face of
the moon; hence we know that it always presents the same side to
the earth. Obviously it must make just one axial to one orbital
revolution. Hold any body before you at arm's-length, revolve it
one-quarter around you until exactly overhead. If it has not revolved
on an axis between the hands, another quarter of the surface is
visible; but if in going up it is turned a quarter over, by the
hands holding it steady, the same side is visible. Three causes
enable us to see a little more than half the moon's surface: 1. The
speed with which it traverses the ellipse of its orbit is variable.
It sometimes gets ahead of us, sometimes behind, and we see farther
around the front or back part. 2. The axis is a little inclined to
the plane of its orbit, and its orbit a little inclined to ours;
hence we see a little over its north pole, and then again over
the south pole. 3. The earth being larger, its inhabitants see
a little more than half-way around a smaller body. These causes
combined enable us to see 576/1000 of the moon's surface. Our eyes
will never see the other side of the moon. If, now, being solid,
her axial revolution could
<a name="page 153"><span class="page">Page 153</span></a>
be increased enough to make one more revolution in two or three
years, that difference between her axial and orbital revolution
would give the future inhabitants of the earth a view of the entire
circumference of the moon. Yet if the moon were once in a fluid
state, or had oceans on the surface, the enormous tide caused by
the earth would produce friction enough, as they moved over the
surface, to gradually retard the axial revolution till the two
tidal elevations remained fixed toward and opposite the earth,
and then the axial and orbital revolutions would correspond, as
at present. In fact, we can prove that the form of the moon is
protuberant toward the earth. Its centre of gravity is thirty-three
miles beyond its centre of magnitude, which is the same in effect
as if a mountain of that enormous height rose on the earth side.
Hence any fluid, as water or air, would flow round to the other
side.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The moon's day, caused by the sun's light, is 29-1/2 times as long
as ours. The sun shines unintermittingly for fifteen days, raising a
temperature as fervid as boiling water. Then darkness and frightful
cold for the same time succeed, except on that half where the earth
acts as a moon. The earth presents the same phases&mdash;crescent,
full, and gibbous&mdash;to the moon as the moon does to us, and
for the same causes. Lord Rosse has been enabled, by his six-foot
reflector, to measure the difference of heat on the moon under
the full blaze of its noonday and midnight. He finds it to be no
less than five hundred degrees. People not enjoying extremes of
temperature should shun a lunar residence. The moon gives us only
1/6180000 as much light as the sun. A sky full of moons would scarcely
make daylight.

There are no indications of air or water on the moon. When it occults
a star it instantly shuts off the light and as instantly reveals
it again. An atmosphere would gradually diminish and reveal the
light, and by refraction
<a name="page 155"><span class="page">Page 155</span></a>
cause the star to be hidden in much less time than the solid body
of the moon would need to pass over it. If the moon ever had air
and water, as it probably did, they are now absorbed in the porous
lava of its substance.
</p>

<h3><i>Telescopic Appearance.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
Probably no one ever saw the moon by means of a good telescope
without a feeling of admiration and awe. Except at full-moon, we
can see where the daylight struggles with the dark along the line
of the moon's sunrise or sunset. This line is called the terminator.
It is broken in the extreme, because the surface is as rough as
possible. In consequence of the small gravitation of the moon,
utter absence of the expansive power of ice shivering the cliffs,
or the levelling power of rains, precipices can stand in
perpendicularity, mountains shoot up like needles, and cavities

three miles deep remain unfilled. The light of the sun falling on
the rough body of the moon, shown in section (Fig. 59), illuminates
the whole cavity at <i>a</i>, part of the one at <i>b</i>, casts
a long shadow from the mountain at <i>c</i>, and touches the tip
of the one at <i>d</i>, which appears to a distant observer as a
point of light beyond the terminator, As the moon revolves the
conical cavity, <i>a</i> is illuminated on the forward side only;
the light creeps down the backward side of cavity <i>b</i> to the
bottom; mountain <i>c</i>. comes directly under the sun and casts
no shadow, and mountain <i>d</i> casts its long shadow over the
plain. Knowing the time of revolution, and observing the change of
<a name="page 156"><span class="page">Page 156</span></a>
illumination, we can easily measure the height of mountain and depth
of crater. An apple, with excavations and added prominences, revolved
on its axis toward the light of a candle, admirably illustrates the
crescent light that fills either side of the cavities and the shadows
of the mountains on the plain. Notice in Fig. 58 the crescent forms
to the right, showing cavities in abundance.

The selenography of one side of the moon is much better known to
us than the geography of the earth. Our maps of the moon are far
more perfect than those of the earth; and the photographs of lunar
objects by Messrs. Draper and De la Rue are wonderfully perfect,
<a name="page 157"><span class="page">Page 157</span></a>
and the drawings of Padre Secchi equally so (Fig. 60). The least
change recognizable from the earth must be speedily detected. There
are frequently reports of discoveries of volcanoes on the moon,
but they prove to be illusions. The moon will probably look the
same to observers a thousand years hence as it does to-day.

<h3><i>Eclipses.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
It is evident that if the plane of the moon's orbit were to correspond
with that of the earth, as they all lie in the plane of the page
(Fig. 61), the moon must pass between the centres of the earth
and sun, and exactly behind the earth at every revolution. Such

<span style="float: left; width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 1em;">

<br />
Fig. 61.&mdash;Eclipses; Shadows of Earth and Moon.
</span>
</span>

successive and total darkenings would greatly derange all affairs
dependent on light. It is easily avoided. Venus does
<a name="page 158"><span class="page">Page 158</span></a>
not cross the disk of the sun at every revolution, because of the
inclination of the plane of its orbit to that of the earth (see
Fig. 41, p. 107). So the plane of the orbit of the moon is inclined
to the orbit of the earth 5&deg; 8' 39"; hence the full-moon is
often above or below the earth's shadow, and the earth is below
or above the moon's shadow at new moon. It is as if the moon's
orbit were pulled up one-quarter of an inch from the page behind
the earth, and depressed as much below it between the earth and
the sun. The point where the orbit of the moon penetrates the plane
of the ecliptic is called a node. If a new moon occur when the
line of intersection of the planes of orbits points to the sun,
the sun must be eclipsed; if the full-moon occur, the moon must
be eclipsed. In any other position the sun or moon will only be
partially hidden, or no eclipse will occur.
</p>

<p class="indent">
If the new moon be near the earth it will completely obscure the
sun. A dime covers it if held close to the eye. It may be so far
from the earth as to only partially hide the sun; and, if it cover
the centre, leave a ring of sunlight on every side. This is called
an annular eclipse. Two such eclipses will occur this year (1879).
If the full-moon passes near the earth, or is at perigee, it finds
the cone of shadow cast by the earth larger, and hence the eclipse
is greater; if it is far from the earth, or near apogee, the earth's
shadow is smaller, and the eclipse less, or is escaped altogether.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There is a certain periodicity in eclipses. Whenever the sun, moon,
and earth are in a line, as in the total eclipse of July 29th,
1878, they will be in the same position after the earth has made
about eighteen revolutions,
<a name="page 159"><span class="page">Page 159</span></a>
and the moon two hundred and sixteen&mdash;that is, eighteen years
after. This period, however, is disregarded by astronomers, and
each eclipse calculated by itself to the accuracy of a second.
</p>

<p class="indent">
How terrible is the fear of ignorance and superstition when the sun
or moon appear to be in the process of destruction! how delightful
are the joys of knowledge when its prophesies in regard to the
heavenly bodies are being fulfilled!

At intervals, on an average of two years one month and nineteen
days, we find rising, as the sun goes down, the reddest star in
the heavens. Its brightness is exceedingly variable; sometimes
it scintillates, and sometimes it shines with a steady light. Its
marked peculiarities demand a close study. We find it to be Mars,
the fiery god of war. Its orbit is far from circular. At perihelion
it is 128,000,000 miles from the sun, and at aphelion 154,000,000;
hence its mean distance is about 141,000,000. So great a change
in its distance from the sun easily accounts for the change in
its brilliancy. Now, if Mars and the earth revolved in circular
orbits, the one 141,000,000 miles from the sun, and the other
92,000,000, they would approach at conjunction within 49,000,000
miles of each other, and at opposition be 233,000,000 miles apart.
But Mars at perihelion may be only 128,000,000 miles from the sun,
and earth at
<a name="page 160"><span class="page">Page 160</span></a>
aphelion may be 94,000,000 miles from the sun. They are, then, but
34,000,000 miles apart. This favorable opportunity occurs about
once in seventy-nine years. At its last occurrence, in 1877, Mars
introduced to us his two satellites, that had never before been
seen by man. In consequence of this greatly varying distance, the
apparent size of Mars differs very much (Fig. 62). Take a favorable

time when the planet is near, also as near overhead as it ever
comes, so as to have as little atmosphere as possible to penetrate,
and study the planet. The first thing that strikes the observer is
a dazzling spot of white near the pole which happens to be toward
him, or at both poles when the planet is so situated that they can be
seen. When the north pole is turned toward the sun the size of the
spot sensibly diminishes, and the spot at the south pole enlarges,
and <i>vice versa</i>. Clearly they are ice-fields. Hence Mars has
water, and air to carry it, and heat to melt ice. It is winter at
the south pole when Mars is farthest from the sun; therefore the
ice-fields are larger than at the north pole. It is summer at the
south pole when Mars is nearest the sun. Hence its ice-fields grow
<a name="page 161"><span class="page">Page 161</span></a>
smaller than those of the north pole in its summer. This carrying of
water from pole to pole, and melting of ice over such large areas,
might give rise to uncomfortable currents in ocean and air; but very
likely an inhabitant of earth might be transported to the surface
of Mars, and be no more surprised at what he observed there than
if he went to some point of the earth to him unknown. Day and night
would be nearly of the same length; winter would linger longer
in the lap of spring; summer would be one hundred and eighty-one
days long; but as the seas are more intermingled with the land, and
the divisions of land have less of continental magnitude, it may
be conjectured that Mars might be a comfortable place of residence
to beings like men. Perhaps the greatest surprise to the earthly
visitor would be to find himself weighing only four-tenths as much
as usual, able to leap twice as high, and lift considerable bowlders.

The night of August 11th, 1877, is famous in modern astronomy.
Mars has been a special object of study in all ages; but on that
evening Professor Hall, of Washington, discovered a satellite of
Mars. On the 16th it was seen again, and its orbital motion followed.
On the following night it was hidden behind the body of the planet
when the observation began, but at the calculated time&mdash;at
four o'clock in the morning&mdash;it emerged, and established its
character as a true moon, and not a fixed star or asteroid. Blessings,
however, never come singly, for another object soon emerged which
proved to be an inner satellite. This is extraordinarily near
<a name="page 162"><span class="page">Page 162</span></a>
the planet&mdash;only four thousand miles from the surface&mdash;and
its revolution is exceedingly rapid. The shortest period hitherto
known is that of the inner satellite of Saturn, 22h. 37m. The inner
satellite of Mars makes its revolution in 7h. 39m.&mdash;a rapidity
so much surpassing the axial revolution of the planet itself, that
it rises in the west and sets in the east, showing all phases of
our moon in one night. The outer satellite is 12,579 miles from
Mars, and makes its revolution in 30h. 18m. Its diameter is six
and a quarter miles; that of the inner one is seven and a half
miles. This can be estimated only by the amount of light given.

<h3>ASTEROIDS.</h3>

<p class="indent">
<b>Already discovered (1879), 192. Distances from the sun, from
200,000,000 to 315,000,000 miles. Diameters, from 20 to 400 miles.
Mass of all, less than one-quarter of the earth.</b>
</p>

<p class="indent">
The sense of infinite variety among the countless number of celestial
orbs has been growing rapidly upon us for half a century, and doubtless
will grow much more in half a century to come. Just as we paused
in the consideration of planets to consider meteors and comets,
at first thought so different, so must we now pause to consider a
ring of bodies, some of which are as small in comparison to Jupiter,
the next planet, as aerolites are compared to the earth.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In 1800 an association of astronomers, suspecting that a planet
might be found in the great distance between Mars and Jupiter,
divided the zodiac into twenty-four parts, and assigned one part to
each astronomer for a thorough search; but, before their organization
could commence work, Piazzi, an Italian astronomer of Palermo,
<a name="page 163"><span class="page">Page 163</span></a>
found in Taurus a star behaving like a planet. In six weeks it was
lost in the rays of the sun. It was rediscovered on its emergence,
and named Ceres. In March, 1802, a second planet was discovered by
Olbers in the same gap between Mars and Jupiter, and named Pallas.
Here was an embarrassment of richness. Olbers suggested that an
original planet had exploded, and that more pieces could be found.
More were found, but the theory is exploded into more pieces than
a planet could possibly be. Up to 1879 one hundred and ninety-two
have been discovered, with a prospect of more. Between 1871-75
forty-five were discovered, showing that they are sought for with
great skill. In the discovery of these bodies, our American astronomers,
Professors Watson and Peters, are without peers.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Between Mars and Jupiter is a distance of some 339,000,000 miles.
Subtract 35,000,000 miles next to Mars and 50,000,000 miles next
to Jupiter, and there is left a zone 254,000,000 miles wide outside
of which the asteroids never wander. If any ever did, the attraction
of Mars or Jupiter may have prevented their return.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Since the orbits of Mars and Jupiter show no sign of being affected
by these bodies for a century past, it is probable that their number
is limited, or at least that their combined mass does not approximate
the size of a planet. Professor Newcomb estimates that if all that
are now discovered were put into one planet, it would not be over
four hundred miles in diameter; and if a thousand more should exist,
of the average size of those discovered since 1850, their addition
would not increase the diameter to more than five hundred miles.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 164"><span class="page">Page 164</span></a>
That all these bodies, which differ from each other in no respect
except in brilliancy, can be noted and fixed so as not to be mistaken
one for another, and instantly recognized though not seen for a
dozen years, is one of the highest exemplifications of the accuracy
of astronomical observation.

Jupiter rightly wears the name of the "giant planet." His orbit
is more nearly circular than most smaller planets. He could not
turn short corners with facility. We know little of his surface.
His spots and belts are
<a name="page 165"><span class="page">Page 165</span></a>
changeable as clouds, which they probably are. Some spots may be
slightly self-luminous, but not the part of the planet we see. It
is covered with an enormous depth of atmosphere. Since the markings
in the belts move about one hundred miles a day, the Jovian tempests
are probably not violent. It is, however, a singular and unaccountable
fact, as remarked by Arago, that its trade-winds move in an opposite
direction from ours. Jupiter receives only one twenty-seventh as
much light and heat from the sun as the earth receives. Its lighter
density, being about that of water, indicates that it still has
internal heat of its own. Indeed, it is likely that this planet
has not yet cooled so as to have any solid crust, and if its dense
vapors could be deposited on the surface, its appearance might
be more suggestive of the sun than of the earth.
</p>

<h3><i>Satellites of Jupiter.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
In one respect Jupiter seems like a minor sun&mdash;he is royally
attended by a group of planets: we call them moons. This system
is a favorite object of study to everyone possessing a telescope.
Indeed, I have known a man who could see these moons with the naked
eye, and give their various positions without mistake. Galileo first
revealed them to ordinary men. We see their orbits so nearly on the
edge that the moons seem to be sliding back and forth across and
behind the disk, and to varying distances on either side. Fig. 64 is
the representation of their appearance at successive observations in
November, 1878. Their motion is so swift, and the means of comparison
by one another and the planet so excellent, that they can be seen
to change their places,
<a name="page 166"><span class="page">Page 166</span></a>
be occulted, emerge from shadow, and eclipse the planet, in an hour's
watching.

It is seen by the above table that all these moons are larger than
ours, one larger than Mercury, and the asteroids are hardly large
enough to make respectable moons for them. They differ in color:
I. and II. have a bluish tinge; III. a yellow; and IV. is red.
The amount of light given by these satellites varies in the most
sudden and inexplicable manner. Perhaps it may be owing to the
different distributions of land and water on them. The mass of all
of them is .000171 of Jupiter.

<p class="indent">

If the Jovian system were the only one in existence, it would be
a surprising object of wonder and study. A monster planet, 85,000
miles in diameter, hung on nothing, revolving its equatorial surface
forty-five miles a minute, holding four other worlds in steady
orbits, some of them at a speed of seven hundred miles a minute,
and the whole system carried through space at five hundred miles
a minute. Yet the discovery of all this display of power, skill,
and stability is only reading the easiest syllables of the vast
literature of wisdom and power.

<h3>SATURN.</h3>

</p>

<p class="indent">
The human mind has used Saturn and the two known planets beyond
for the last 200 years as a gymnasium. It has exercised itself
in comprehending their enormous distances in order to clear those
greater spaces, to where the stars are set; it has exercised its
ingenuity at interpreting appearances which signify something other
than they seem, in order that it may no longer be deluded by any
sunrises into a belief that the heavenly dome goes round the earth.
That a wandering point of light should develop into such amazing
grandeurs under the telescope, is as unexpected as that every tiny
seed should show peculiar markings and colors under the microscope.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are certain things that are easy to determine, such as size,
density, periodic time, velocity, etc.; but other things are exceedingly
difficult to determine. It requires long sight to read when the
book is held
<a name="page 168"><span class="page">Page 168</span></a>
800,000,000 miles away. Only very few, if more than two, opportunities
have been found to determine the time of Saturn's rotation. On the
evening of December 7th, 1870, Professor Hall observed a brilliant

white spot suddenly show itself on the body of this planet. It was
as if an eruption of white hot matter burst up from the interior. It
spread eastward, and remained bright till January, when it faded. No
such opportunity for getting a basis on which to found a calculation
of the time of the rotation of Saturn has occurred since Sir William
Herschel's observations; and, very singularly, the two times deduced
wonderfully coincide&mdash;that of Herschel being 10h. 16m., that
of Mr. Hall being 10h. 14m.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 169"><span class="page">Page 169</span></a>
The density of Saturn is less than that of water, and its velocity
of rotation so great that centrifugal force antagonizes gravitation
to such an extent that bodies weigh on it about the same as on the
earth. All the fine fancies of the habitability of this vaporous
world, all the calculations of the number of people that could
live on the square miles of the planet and its enormous rings,
are only fancy. Nothing could live there with more brains than a
fish, at most. It is a world in formative processes. We cannot hear
the voice of the Creator there, but we can see matter responsive
to the voice, and moulded by his word.
</p>

<h3><i>Rings of Saturn.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
The eye and mind of man have worked out a problem of marvellous
difficulty in finding a true solution of the strange appearance
of the rings. Galileo has the immortal honor of first having seen
something peculiar about this planet. He wrote to the Duke of Tuscany,
"When I view Saturn it seems <i>tricorps</i>. The central body
seems the largest. The two others, situated, the one on the east,
and the other on the west, seem to touch it. They are like two
supporters, who help old Saturn on his way, and always remain at
his side." Looking a few years later, the rings having turned from
view, he said, "It is possible that some demon mocked me;" and
he refused to look any more.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Huyghens, in March, 1655, solved the problem of the triform appearance
of Saturn. He saw them as handles on the two sides. In a year they
had disappeared, and the planet was as round as it seemed to Galileo
in 1612. He did not, however, despair; and in October,
<a name="page 170"><span class="page">Page 170</span></a>
1656, he was rewarded by seeing them appear again. He wrote of Saturn,
"It is girdled by a thin plain ring, nowhere touching, inclined to
the ecliptic."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Since that time discoveries have succeeded one another rapidly.
"We have seen by degrees a ring evolved out of a triform planet,
and the great division of the ring and the irregularities on it
brought to light. Enceladus, and coy Mimas, faintest of twinklers,
are caught by Herschel's giant mirrors. And he, too, first of men,
realizes the wonderful tenuity of the ring, along which he saw
those satellites travelling like pearls strung on a silver thread.
Then Bond comes on the field, and furnishes evidence to show that
we must multiply the number of separate rings we know not how many
fold. And here we reach the golden age of Saturnian discovery,
when Bond, with the giant refractor of Cambridge, and Dawes, with
his 6-1/3-inch Munich glass, first beheld that wonderful dark
semi-transparent ring, which still remains one of the wonders of
our system. But the end is not yet: on the southern surface of
the ring, ere summer fades into autumn, Otto Struve in turn comes
upon the field, detects, as Dawes had previously done, a division
even in the dark ring, and measures it, while it is invisible to
Lassell's mirror&mdash;a proof, if one were needed, of the enormous
superiority possessed by refractors in such inquiries. Then we
approach 1861, when the ring plane again passes through the earth,
and Struve and Wray observe curious nebulous appearances."[*]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: Lockyer.]
</p>

<p class="indent">
Our opportunities for seeing Saturn vary greatly. As the earth at
one part of its orbit presents its south pole
<a name="page 171"><span class="page">Page 171</span></a>
to the sun, then its equator, then the north pole, so Saturn; and
we, in the direction of the sun, see the south side of the rings
inclined at an angle of 27&deg;; next the edge of the rings, like a
fine thread of light; then the north side at a similar inclination.
On February 7th, 1878, Saturn was between Aquarius and Pisces,
with the edge of the ring to the sun. In 1885, the planet being in
Taurus, the south side of the rings will be seen at the greatest
advantage. From 1881 till 1885 all circumstances will combine to
give most favorable studies of Saturn. Meanwhile study the picture
of it. The outer ring is narrow, dark, showing hints of another
division, sometimes more evident than at others, as if it were
in a state of flux. The inner, or second, ring is much brighter,
especially on the outer edge, and shading off to the dusky edge
next to the planet. There is no sign of division into a third dusky
innermost ring, as was plainly seen by Bond. This, too, may be in
a state of flux.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The markings of the planet are delicate, difficult of detection,
and are not like those stark zebra stripes that are so often
represented.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The distance between the planet and the second ring seems to be
diminished one-half since 1657, and this ring has doubled its breadth
in the same time. Some of this difference may be owing to our greater
telescopic power, enabling us to see the ring closer to the planet;
but in all probability the ring is closing in upon the central
body, and will touch it by A.D. 2150. Thus the whole ring must
ultimately fall upon the planet, instead of making a satellite.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We are anxious to learn the nature of such a ring.
<a name="page 172"><span class="page">Page 172</span></a>
Laplace mathematically demonstrated that it cannot be uniform and
solid, and survive. Professor Peirce showed it could not be fluid,
and continue. Then Professor Maxwell showed that it must be formed
of clouds of satellites too small to be seen individually, and too
near together for the spaces to be discerned, unless, perhaps, we
may except the inner dark ring, where they are not near enough to
make it positively luminous. Indeed, there is some evidence that
the meteoroids are far enough apart to make the ring partially
transparent.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We look forward to the opportunities for observation in 1882 with
the brightest hope that these difficult questions will be solved.
</p>

<h3><i>Satellites of Saturn.</i></h3>

The first discovered satellite of Saturn seen by Huyghens was in

in 1848. These are eight in number, and are named:

Titan can be seen by almost any telescope; I., II., and III., only
by the most powerful instrument. All except Japetus revolve nearly
in the plane of the ring. Like the moons of Jupiter, they present
remarkable and unaccountable variations of brilliancy. An inspection
<a name="page 173"><span class="page">Page 173</span></a>
of the table reveals either an expectation that another moon will
be discovered between V. and VI., and about three more between
VII. and VIII., or that these gaps may be filled with groups of
invisible asteroids, as the gap between Mars and Jupiter. This
will become more evident by drawing Saturn, the rings, and orbits
of the moons all as circles, on a scale of 10,000 miles to the
inch. Saturn will be in the centre, 70,000 miles in diameter; then
a gap, decreasing twenty-nine miles a year to the first ring, of,
say, 10,000 miles; a dark ring 9000 miles wide; next the brightest
ring 18,300 miles wide; then a gap of 1750 miles; then the outer
ring 10,000 miles wide; then the orbits of the satellites in order.

<p class="indent">
If the scenery of Jupiter is magnificent, that of Saturn must be
sublime. If one could exist there, he might wander from the illuminated
side of the rings, under their magnificent arches, to the darkened
side, see the swift whirling moons; one of them presenting ten times
the disk of the earth's moon, and so very near as to enable him
to watch the advancing line of light that marks the lunar morning
journeying round that orb.

Uranus was presented to the knowledge of man as an unexpected reward
for honest work. It was first mistaken by its discoverer for a comet,
a mere cloud of vapor; but it proved to be a world, and extended the
<a name="page 174"><span class="page">Page 174</span></a>
boundaries of our solar system, in the moment of its discovery,
as much as all investigation had done in all previous ages.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Sir William Herschel was engaged in mapping stars in 1781, when he
first observed its sea-green disk. He proposed to call it <i>Georgium
Sidus</i>, in honor of his king; but there were too many names
of the gods in the sky to allow a mortal name to be placed among
them. It was therefore called Uranus, since, being the most distant
body of our system, as was supposed, it might appropriately bear
the name of the oldest god. Finding anything in God's realms of
infinite riches ought not to lead men to regard that as final,
but as a promise of more to follow.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This planet had been seen five times by Flamsteed before its character
was determined&mdash;once nearly a century before&mdash;and eight
times by Le Monnier. These names, which might easily have been
associated with a grand discovery, are associated with careless
observation. Eyes were made not only to be kept open, but to have
minds behind them to interpret their visions. Herschel thought
he discovered six moons belonging to Uranus, but subsequent
investigation has limited the number to four. Two of these are seen
with great difficulty by the most powerful telescopes.
</p>

<p class="indent">
If the plane of our moon's orbit were tipped up to a greater
inclination, revolving it on the line of nodes as an axis until
it was turned 85&deg;, the moon, still continuing on its orbit in
that plane, would go over the poles instead of about the equator,
and would go back to its old path when the plane was revolved 180&deg;;
but its revolution would now be from east to west, or
<a name="page 175"><span class="page">Page 175</span></a>
retrograde. The plane of the moons of Uranus has been thus inclined
till it has passed 10&deg; beyond the pole, and the moons' motions
are retrograde as regards other known celestial movements. How Uranus
itself revolves is not known. There are more worlds to conquer.

Men sought for Neptune as the heroes sought the golden fleece.
The place of Uranus had been mapped for nearly one hundred years
by these accidental observations. On applying the law of universal
gravitation, a slight discrepancy was found between its computed
place and its observed place. This discrepancy was exceedingly
slight. In 1830 it was only 20"; in 1840,190"; in 1884, 2'. Two
stars that were 2' apart would appear as one to the keenest unaided
eye, but such an error must not exist in astronomy. Years of work
were given to its correction. Mr. John C. Adams, of Cambridge,
England, finding that the attraction of a planet exterior to Uranus
would account for its irregularities, computed the place of such
a hypothetical body with singular exactness in October, 1841; but
neither he nor the royal astronomer Airy looked for it. Another
opportunity for immortality was heedlessly neglected. Meanwhile,
M. Leverrier, of Paris, was working at the same problem. In the
summer of 1846 Leverrier announced the place of the exterior planet.
The conclusion was in striking coincidence with that of Mr.
<a name="page 176"><span class="page">Page 176</span></a>
Clark. Mr. Challis commenced to search for the planet near the
indicated place, and actually saw and mapped the star August 4th,
1846, but did not recognize its planetary character. Dr. Galle,
of Berlin, on the 23d of September, 1846, found an object with a
planetary disk not plotted on the map of stars. It was the sought-for
world. It would seem easy to find a world seventy-six times as large
as the earth, and easy to recognize it when seen. The fact that
it could be discovered only by such care conveys an overwhelming
idea of the distance where it moves.

<p class="indent">
The effect of these perturbations by an exterior planet is understood
from Fig. 66. Uranus and Neptune were in conjunction, as shown,
in 1822. But in 1820 it had been found that Uranus was too far
from the sun, and too much accelerated. Since 1800, Neptune, in
his orbit from F to E, had been hastening Uranus in his orbit D
from C to B, and also drawing it farther from the sun. After 1822,
Neptune, in passing from E to D, had been retarding Uranus in his
orbit from B to A.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We have seen it is easy to miss immortality. There is still another
instance. Lalande saw Neptune on May 8th and 10th, 1795, noted that
it had moved a little, and that the observations did not agree;
but, supposing the first was wrong, carelessly missed the glory
of once more doubling the bounds of the empire of the sun.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 177"><span class="page">Page 177</span></a>
It is time to pause and review our knowledge of this system. The
first view reveals a moon and earth endowed with a force of inertia
going on in space in straight lines; but an invisible elastic cord of
attraction holds them together, just counterbalancing this tendency
to fly apart, and hence they circle round their centre of gravity.
The revolving earth turns every part of its surface to the moon in
each twenty-four hours. By an axial revolution in the same time
that the moon goes round the earth, the moon holds the same point
of its surface constantly toward the earth. If we were to add one,
two, four, eight moons at appropriate distances, the result would be
the same. There is, however, another attractive influence&mdash;that
of the sun. The sun attracts both earth and moon, but their nearer
affection for each other keeps them from going apart. They both,
revolving on their axes and around their centre of gravity, sweep
in a vastly wider curve around the sun. Add as many moons as has
Jupiter or Saturn, the result is the same&mdash;an orderly carrying
of worlds through space.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There lies the unsupported sun in the centre, nearer to infinity
in all its capacities and intensities of force than our minds can
measure, filling the whole dome to where the stars are set with
light, heat, and power. It holds five small worlds&mdash;Vulcan,
Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars&mdash;within a space whose radius
it would require a locomotive half a thousand years to traverse.
It next holds some indeterminate number of asteroids, and the great
Jupiter, equal in volume to 13,000 earths. It holds Saturn, Uranus,
and Neptune, and all their variously related satellites and rings.
The two thoughts that overwhelm us are distance and power. The
period of
<a name="page 178"><span class="page">Page 178</span></a>
man's whole history is not sufficient for an express train to traverse
half the distance to Neptune. Thought wearies and fails in seeking
to grasp such distances; it can scarcely comprehend one million
miles, and here are thousands of them. Even the wings of imagination
grow weary and droop. When we stand on that outermost of planets,
the very last sentinel of the outposts of the king, the very sun
grown dim and small in the distance, we have taken only one step
of the infinite distance to the stars. They have not changed their
relative position&mdash;they have not grown brighter by our approach.
Neptune carries us round a vast circle about the centre of the dome
of stars, but we seem no nearer its sides. In visiting planets,
we have been only visiting next-door neighbors in the streets of
a seaport town. We know that there are similar neighbors about
Sirius and Arcturus, but a vast sea rolls between. As we said, we
stand with the outermost sentinel; but into the great void beyond
the king of day sends his comets as scouts, and they fly thousands
of years without for one instant missing the steady grasp of the
power of the sun. It is nearer almightiness than we are able to
think.
</p>

<p class="indent">
If we cannot solve the problems of the present existence of worlds,
how little can we expect to fathom the unsoundable depths of their
creation and development through ages measureless to man! Yet the
very difficulty provokes the most ambitious thought. We toil at
the problem because it has been hitherto unsolvable. Every error
we make, and discover to be such, helps toward the final solution.
Every earnest thinker who climbs the shining worlds as steps to
a higher thought is trying to solve the problem God has given us
to do.

<i>THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
The method by which the solar system came into its present form
was sketched in vast outline by Moses. He gave us the fundamental
idea of what is called the nebular hypothesis. Swedenborg, that
prodigal dreamer of vagaries, in 1734 threw out some conjectures of
the way in which the outlines were to be filled up; Buffon followed
him closely in 1749; Kant sought to give it an ideal philosophical
completeness; as he said, "not as the result of observation and
computation," but as evolved out of his own consciousness; and
Laplace sought to settle it on a mathematical basis.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It has been modified greatly by later writers, and must receive
still greater modifications before it can be accepted by the best
scientists of to-day. It has been called "the grandest generalization
of the human mind;" and if it shall finally be so modified as to pass
from a tentative hypothesis to an accepted philosophy, declaring
the modes of a divine worker rather than the necessities of blind
force, it will still be worthy of that high distinction.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Let it be clearly noted that it never proposes to do more than to
trace a portion of the mode of working which brought the universe
from one stage to another. It only goes back to a definite point,
never to absolute beginning, nor to nothingness. It takes matter from
<a name="page 182"><span class="page">Page 182</span></a>
the hand of the unseen power behind, and merely notes the progress
of its development. It finds the clay in the hands of an intelligent
potter, and sees it whirl in the process of formation into a vessel.
It is not in any sense necessarily atheistic, any more than it is
to affirm that a tree grows by vital processes in the sun and dew,
instead of being arbitrarily and instantly created. The conclusion
reached depends on the spirit of the observer. Newton could say,
"This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets could
only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and
powerful being!" Still it is well to recognize that some of its most
ardent defenders have advocated it as materialistic. And Laplace
said of it to Napoleon, "I have no need of the hypothesis of a
god."
</p>

<p class="indent">
The materialistic statement of the theory is this: that matter
is at first assumed to exist as an infinite cloud of fire-mist,
dowered with power latent therein to grow of itself into every
possibility of world, flower, animal, man, mind, and affection,
without any interference or help from without. But it requires
far more of the Divine Worker than any other theory. He must fill
matter with capabilities to take care of itself, and this would
tax the abilities of the Infinite One far more than a constant
supervision and occasional interference. Instead of making the
vase in perfect form, and coloring it with exquisite beauty by
an ever-present skill, he must endow the clay with power to make
itself in perfect form, adorn itself with delicate beauty, and
create other vases.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The nebular hypothesis is briefly this: All the matter composing
all the bodies of the sun, planets, and satellites once existed
in an exceedingly diffused state;
<a name="page 183"><span class="page">Page 183</span></a>
rarer than any gas with which we are acquainted, filling a space
larger than the orbit of Neptune. Gravitation gradually contracted
this matter into a condensing globe of immense extent. Some parts would
naturally be denser than others, and in the course of contraction a
rotary motion, it is affirmed, would be engendered. Rotation would
flatten the globe somewhat in the line of its axis. Contracting
still more, the rarer gases, aided by centrifugal force, would be
left behind as a ring that would ultimately be separated, like
Saturn's ring, from the retreating body. There would naturally be
some places in this ring denser than others; these would gradually
absorb all the ring into a planet, and still revolve about the
central mass, and still rotate on its own axis, throwing off rings
from itself. Thus the planet Neptune would be left behind in the
first sun-ring, to make its one moon; the planet Uranus left in
the next sun-ring, to make its four moons from four successive
planet-rings; Saturn, with its eight moons and three rings not
made into moons, is left in the third sun-ring; and so on down to
Vulcan.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The outer planets would cool off first, become inhabitable, and,
as the sun contracted and they radiated their own heat, become
refrigerated and left behind by the retreating sun. Of course the
outer planets would move slowly; but as that portion of the sun
which gave them their motion drew in toward the centre, keeping
its absolute speed, and revolving in the lessening circles of a
contracting body, it would give the faster motion necessary to
be imparted to Earth, Mercury, and Vulcan.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The four great classes of facts confirmatory of this hypothesis
are as follows: 1st. All the planets move
<a name="page 184"><span class="page">Page 184</span></a>
in the same direction, and nearly in the same plane, as if thrown
off from one equator; 2d. The motions of the satellites about their
primaries are mostly in the same direction as that of their primaries
about the sun; 3d. The rotation of most of these bodies on their
axes, and also of the sun, is in the same direction as the motion of
the planets about the sun; 4th. The orbits of the planets, excluding
asteroids, and their satellites, have but a comparatively small
eccentricity; 5th. Certain nebul&aelig; are observable in the heavens
which are not yet condensed into solids, but are still bright gas.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The materialistic evolutionist takes up the idea of a universe of
material world-stuff without form, and void, but so endowed as to
develop itself into orderly worlds, and adds to it this exceeding
advance, that when soil, sun, and chemical laws found themselves
properly related, a force in matter, latent for a million eons in
the original cloud, comes forward, and dead matter becomes alive
in the lowest order of vegetable life; there takes place, as Herbert
Spencer says, "a change from an indefinite, incoherent homogeneity,
into a definite, coherent heterogeneity, through continuous
differentiation and integration." The dead becomes alive; matter
passes from unconsciousness to consciousness; passes up from plant
to animal, from animal to man; takes on power to think, reason,
love, and adore. The theistic evolutionist may think that the same
process is gone through, but that an ever-present and working God
superintends, guides, and occasionally bestows a new endowment
of power that successively gives life, consciousness, mental,
affectional, and spiritual capacity.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Is this world-theory true? and if so, is either of the
<a name="page 185"><span class="page">Page 185</span></a>
evolution theories true also? If the first evolution theory is
true, the evolved man will hardly know which to adore most, the
Being that could so endow matter, or the matter capable of such
endowment.
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are some difficulties in the way of the acceptance of the
nebular hypothesis that compel many of the most thorough scientists
of the day to withhold their assent to its entirety. The latest,
and one of the most competent writers on the subject, Professor
Newcomb, who is a mathematical astronomer, and not an easy theorist,
evolving the system of the universe from the depth of his own
consciousness, says: "Should any one be sceptical as to the sufficiency
of these laws to account for the present state of things, science
can furnish no evidence strong enough to overthrow his doubts until
the sun shall be found to be growing smaller by actual measurement,
or the nebul&aelig; be actually seen to condense into stars and
systems." In one of the most elaborate defences of the theory, it
is argued that the hypothesis explains why only one of the four
planets nearest the sun can have a moon, and why there can be no
planet inside of Mercury. The discovery of the two satellites to
Mars and of the planet Vulcan makes it all the worse for these
facts.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Some of the objections to the theory should be known by every thinker.
Laplace must have the cloud "diffused in consequence of excessive
heat," etc. Helmholtz, in order to account for the heat of the
contracting sun, must have the cloud relatively cold. How he and
his followers diffused the cloud without heat is not stated.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The next difficulty is that of rotation. The laws
<a name="page 186"><span class="page">Page 186</span></a>
of science compel a contraction into one non-rotating body&mdash;a
central sun, indeed, but no planets about it. Laplace cleverly
evades the difficulty by not taking from the hand of the Creator
diffused gas, but a sun with an atmosphere filling space to the
orbit of Neptune, and <i>already in revolution</i>. He says: "It
is four millions to one that all motions of the planets, rotations
and revolutions, were at once imparted by an original common cause,
of which we know neither the nature nor the epoch." Helmholtz says
of rotation, "the existence of which must be assumed." Professor
Newcomb says that the planets would not be arranged as now, each
one twice as far from the sun as the next interior one, and the
outer ones made first, but that all would be made into planets
at once, and the small inner ones quite likely to cool off more
rapidly.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is a very serious difficulty that at least one satellite does
not revolve in the right direction. How Neptune or Uranus could
throw their moons backward from its equator is not easily accounted
for. It is at least one Parthian arrow at the system, not necessarily
fatal, but certainly dangerous.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A greater difficulty is presented by the recently discovered satellites
of Mars. The inner one goes round the planet in one-third part of
the time of the latter's revolution. How Mars could impart three
times the speed to a body flying off its surface that it has itself,
has caused several defenders of the hypothesis to rush forward
with explanations, but none with anything more than mere imaginary
collisions with some comet. It is to be noticed that accounting for
three times the speed is not enough; for as Mars shrunk away from the
<a name="page 187"><span class="page">Page 187</span></a>
ring that formed that satellite, it ought itself to attain more
speed, as the sun revolves faster than its planets, and the earth
faster than its moon. In defending the hypothesis, Mitchel said:
"Suppose we had discovered that it required more time for Saturn
or Jupiter to rotate on their axes than for their nearest moon to
revolve round them in its orbit; this would have falsified the
theory." It is also asserted that the newly discovered planet Vulcan
makes an orbital in less time than the sun makes an axial revolution.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In regard to one Martial moon, Professor Kirkwood, on whom Proctor
conferred the highest title that could be conferred, "the modern
Kepler," says: "Unless some explanation can be given, the short period
of the inner satellite will be doubtless regarded as a conclusive
argument against the nebular hypothesis." If gravitation be sufficient
to account for the various motions of the heavenly bodies, we have
a perplexing problem in the star known as 1830 Groombridge, now
in the Hunting Dogs of Bootes. It is thought to have a speed of
two hundred miles per second&mdash;a velocity that all the known
matter in the universe could not give to the star by all its combined
attraction. Neither could all that attraction stop the motion of
the star, or bend it into an orbit. Its motion must be accounted
for on some hypothesis other than the nebular.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The nebul&aelig; which we are able to observe are not altogether
confirmatory of the hypothesis under consideration. They have the
most fantastic shapes, as if they had no relation to rotating suns
in the formative stages. There are vast gaps in the middle, where
they ought to be densest. Mr. Plumer, in the <i>Natural Science
Review</i>,
<a name="page 188"><span class="page">Page 188</span></a>
says, in regard to the results of the spectroscopic revelations:
"We are furnished with distinct proof that the gases so examined
are not only of nearly equal density, but that they exist in a low
state of <i>tension. This fact is fatal to the nebular theory.</i>"
</p>

<p class="indent">
In the autumn of 1876 a star blazed out in Cygnus, which promised
to throw a flood of light on the question of world-making. Its
spectrum was like some of the fixed stars. It probably blazed ont
by condensation from some previously invisible nebula. But its
brilliancy diminished swiftly, when it ought to have taken millions
of years to cool. If the theory was true, it ought to have behaved very
differently. It should have regularly condensed from gas to a solid
sun by slow process. But, worst of all, after being a star awhile, it
showed unmistakable proofs of turning into a cloud-mist&mdash;a star
into a nebula, instead of <i>vice versa</i>. A possible explanation
will be considered under variable stars.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Such are a few of the many difficulties in the way of accepting
the nebular hypothesis, as at present explained, as being the true
mode of development of the solar system. Doubtless it has come
from a hot and diffused condition into its present state; but when
such men as Proctor, Newcomb, and Kirkwood see difficulties that
cannot be explained, contradictions that cannot be reconciled by
the principles of this theory, surely lesser men are obliged to
suspend judgment, and render the Scotch verdict of "not proven."
Whatever truth there may be in the theory will survive, and be
incorporated into the final solution of the problem; which solution
will be a much grander generalization of the human mind than the
nebular hypothesis.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 189"><span class="page">Page 189</span></a>
Of some things we feel very sure: that matter was once without
form and void, and darkness rested on the face of the mighty deeps;
that, instead of chaos, we have now cosmos and beauty; and that
there is some process by which matter has been brought from one
state to the other. Whether, however, the nebular hypothesis lays
down the road travelled to this transfiguration, we are not sure.
Some of it seems like solid rock, and some like shifting quicksand.
Doubtless there is a road from that chaos to this fair cosmos.
The nebular hypothesis has surveyed, worked, and perfected many
long reaches of this road, but the rivers are not bridged, the
chasms not filled, nor the mountains tunnelled.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When men attempt to roll the hypothesis of evolution along the
road of the nebular hypothesis of worlds, and even beyond to the
production of vegetable and animal life, mind and affection, the
gaps in the road become evident, and disastrous.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A soul that has reached an adoration for the Supreme Father cares
not how he has made him. Doubtless the way God chose was the best.
It is as agreeable to have been thought of and provided for in the
beginning, to have had a myriad ages of care, and to have come
from the highest existent life at last, as to have been made at
once, by a single act, out of dust. The one who is made is not to
say to the Maker, "Why hast thou formed me in this or that manner?"
We only wish the question answered in what manner we were really
made.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Evolution, without constant superintendence and occasional new
inspiration of power, finds some tremendous chasms in the road
it travels. These must be spanned by the power of a present God
or the airy imagination
<a name="page 190"><span class="page">Page 190</span></a>
of man. Dr. McCosh has happily enumerated some of these tremendous
gaps over which mere force cannot go. Given, then, matter with
mechanical power only, what are the gaps between it and spirituality?
</p>

<p class="indent">
"1. Chemical action cannot be produced by mechanical power.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"2. Life, even in the lowest forms, cannot be produced from unorganized
matter.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"3. Protoplasm can be produced only by living matter.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"4. Organized matter is made up of cells, and can be produced only
by cells. Whence the first cell?
</p>

<p class="indent">
"5. A living being can be produced only from a seed or germ. Whence
the first vegetable seed?
</p>

<p class="indent">
"6. An animal cannot be produced from a plant. Whence the first
animal?
</p>

<p class="indent">
"7. Sensation cannot be produced in insentient matter.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"8. The genesis of a new species of plant or animal has never come
under the cognizance of man, either in pre-human or post-human ages,
either in pre-scientific or scientific times. Darwin acknowledges
this, and says that, should a new species suddenly arise, we have
no means of knowing that it is such.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"9. Consciousness&mdash;that is, a knowledge of self and its
operations&mdash;cannot be produced out of mere matter or sensation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"10. We have no knowledge of man being generated out of the lower
animals.
</p>

<p class="indent">
"11. All human beings, even savages, are capable of forming certain
high ideas, such as those of God and duty. The brute creatures
cannot be made to entertain these by any training.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 191"><span class="page">Page 191</span></a>
"With such tremendous gaps in the process, the theory which would
derive all things out of matter by development is seen to be a
very precarious one.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The truth, according to the best judgment to be formed in the present
state of knowledge, would seem to be about this: The nebular hypothesis
is correct in all the main facts on which it is based; but that neither
the present forces of matter, nor any other forces conceivable to
the mind of man, with which it can possibly be endowed, can account
for all the facts already observed. There is a demand for a personal
volition, for an exercise of intelligence, for the following of a
divine plan that embraces a final perfection through various and
changeful processes. The five great classes of facts that sustain
the nebular hypothesis seem set before us to show the regular order
of working. The several facts that will not, so far as at present
known, accord with that plan, seem to be set before us to declare
the presence of a divine will and power working his good pleasure
according to the exigencies of time and place.

<h3><i>THE OPEN PAGE OF THE HEAVENS.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
The Greeks set their mythological deities in the skies, and read
the revolving pictures as a starry poem. Not that they were the
first to set the blazonry of the stars as monuments of their thought;
we read certain allusions to stars and asterisms as far back as
the time of Job. And the Pleiades, Arcturus, and Orion are some of
the names used by Him who "calleth all the stars by their names,
in the greatness of his power." Homer and Hesiod, 750 B.C., allude
to a few stars and groups. The Arabians very early speak of the
Great Bear; but the Greeks completely nationalized the heavens.
They colonized the earth widely, but the heavens completely; and
nightly over them marched the grand procession of their apotheosized
divinities. There Hercules perpetually wrought his mighty labors
for the good of man; there flashed and faded the changeful star
Algol, as an eye in the head of the snaky-haired Medusa; over them
flew Pegasus, the winged horse of the poet, careering among the
stars; there the ship Argo, which had explored all strange seas
of earth, nightly sailed in the infinite realms of heaven; there
Perseus perpetually killed the sea-monster by celestial aid, and
perpetually won the chained Andromeda for his bride. Very evident
was their recognition of divine help: equally evident was
<a name="page 196"><span class="page">Page 196</span></a>
their assertion of human ability and dominion. They gathered the
illimitable stars, and put uncountable suns into the shape of the
Great Bear&mdash;the most colossal form of animal ferocity and
strength&mdash;across whose broad forehead imagination grows weary
in flying; but they did not fail to put behind him a representative
of themselves, who forever drives him around a sky that never
sets&mdash;a perpetual type that man's ambition and expectation
correspond to that which has always been revealed as the divine.

The heavens signify much higher power and wisdom to us; we retain the
old pictures and groupings for the convenience of finding individual
stars. It is enough for the astronomer that we speak of a star as
situated right ascension 13' 45", declination 88&deg; 40'. But
for most people, if not all, it is better to call it Polaris. So
we might speak of a lake in latitude 42&deg; 40', longitude 79&deg;
22', but it would be clearer to most persons to say Chatauqua. For
exact location of a star, right ascension and declination must be
given; but for general indication its name or place in a constellation
is sufficiently exact. The heaven is rather indeterminably laid out
in irregular tracts, and the mythological names are preserved.
The brightest stars are then indicated in order by the letters of
the Greek alphabet&mdash;Alpha (&alpha;), Beta (&beta;), Gamma
(&gamma;), etc. After these are exhausted, the Roman alphabet is
used in the same manner, and then numbers are resorted to; so that
the famous star 61 Cygni is the 111th star in brightness in that
one constellation. An acquaintance with the names, peculiarities,
and movements of the stars visible at different seasons of the
year is an unceasing source of pleasure. It
<a name="page 197"><span class="page">Page 197</span></a>
is not vision alone that is gratified, for one fine enough may
hear the morning stars sing together, and understand the speech
that day uttereth unto day, and the knowledge that night showeth
unto night. One never can be alone if he is familiarly acquainted
with the stars. He rises early in the summer morning, that he may
see his winter friends; in winter, that he may gladden himself
with a sight of the summer stars. He hails their successive rising
as he does the coming of his personal friends from beyond the sea.
On the wide ocean he is commercing with the skies, his rapt soul
sitting in his eyes. Under the clear skies of the East he hears
God's voice speaking to him, as to Abraham, and saying, "Look now
toward the heavens, and tell the number of the stars, if thou be
able to number them."
</p>

<p class="indent">
A general acquaintance with the stars will be first attempted;
a more particular knowledge afterward. Fig. 67 (<a
href="#page 201">page 201</a>) is a map of the circumpolar region,
which is in full view every clear night. It revolves daily round
Polaris, its central point. Toward this star, the two end stars of
the Great Dipper ever point, and are in consequence called "the
Pointers." The map may be held toward the northern sky in such a
position as the stars may happen to be. The Great Bear, or Dipper,
will be seen at nine o'clock in the evening above the pole in April
and May; west of the pole, the Pointers downward, in July and August;
close to the north horizon in October and November; and east of the
pole the Pointers highest, in January and February. The names of
such constantly visible stars should be familiar. In order, from
the end of the tail of the Great Bear, we have Benetnasch &eta;,
Mizar &zeta;, Little Alcor close to it,
<a name="page 198"><span class="page">Page 198</span></a>
Alioth, &epsilon; Megrez, &delta; at the junction, has been growing
dimmer for a century, Phad, &gamma; Dubhe and Merak. It is best to
get some facility at estimating distances in degrees. Dubhe and
Merak, "the Pointers," are five degrees apart. Eighteen degrees
forward of Dubhe is the Bear's nose; and three pairs of stars,
fifteen degrees apart, show the position of the Bear's three feet.
Follow "the Pointers" twenty-nine degrees from Dubhe, and we come to
the pole-star. This star is double, made of two suns, both appearing
as one to the naked eye. It is a test of an excellent three-inch
telescope to resolve it into two. Three stars beside it make the
curved-up handle of the Little Dipper of Ursa Minor. Between the
two Bears, thirteen degrees from Megrez, and eleven degrees from
Mizar, are two stars in the tail of the Dragon, which curves about
to appropriate all the stars not otherwise assigned. Follow a curve
of fifteen stars, doubling back to a quadrangle from five to three
degrees on a side, and thirty-five degrees from the pole, for his
head. His tongue runs out to a star four degrees in front. We shall
find, hereafter, that the foot of Hercules stands on this head.
This is the Dragon slain by Cadmus, and whose teeth produced such
a crop of sanguinary men.

The star Thuban was once the pole-star. In the year B.C. 2300 it
was ten times nearer the pole than Polaris is now. In the year
A.D. 2100 the pole will be within 30' of Polaris; in A.D. 7500,
it will be at &alpha; of Cepheus; in A.D. 13,500, within 7&deg; of
Vega; in A.D. 15,700, at the star in the tongue of Draco; in A.D.
23,000, at Thuban; in A.D. 28,000, back to Polaris. This indicates
no change in the position of the dome
<a name="page 199"><span class="page">Page 199</span></a>
of stars, but a change in the direction of the axis of the earth
pointing to these various places as the cycles pass. As the earth
goes round its orbit, the axis, maintaining nearly the same direction,
really points to every part of a circle near the north star as large
as the earth's orbit, that is, 185,000,000 miles in diameter. But,
as already shown, that circle is too small to be discernible at our
distance. The wide circle of the pole through the ages is really
made up of the interlaced curves of the annual curves continued
through 25,870 years. The stem of the spinning top wavers, describes
a circle, and finally falls; the axis of the spinning earth wavers,
describes a circle of nearly 28,000 years, and never falls.

<p class="indent">
The star &gamma; Draconis, also called Etanin, is famous in modern
astronomy, because observations on this star led to the discovery
of the <i>aberration of light</i>. If we held a glass tube
perpendicularly out of the window of a car at rest, when the rain
was falling straight down, we could see the drops pass directly
through. Put the car in motion, and the drops would seem to start
toward us, and the top of the tube must be bent forward, or the
drops entering would strike on the backside of the tube carried
toward them. So our telescopes are bent forward on the moving earth,
to enable the entered light to reach the eye-piece. Hence the star
does not appear just where it is. As the earth moves faster in
some parts of its orbit than others, this aberration is sometimes
greater than at others. It is fortunate that light moves with a
uniform velocity, or this difficult, problem would be still further
complicated. The displacement of a star from this course is about
20".43.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 200"><span class="page">Page 200</span></a>
On the side of Polaris, opposite to Ursa Major, is King Cepheus,
made of a few dim stars in the form of the letter K. Near by is
his brilliant wife Cassiopeia, sitting on her throne of state.
They were the graceless parents who chained their daughter to a
rock for the sea-monster to devour; but Perseus, swift with the
winged sandals of Mercury, terrible with his avenging sword, and
invincible with the severed head of Medusa, whose horrid aspect of
snaky hair and scaly body turned to stone every beholder, rescues
the maiden from chains, and leads her away by the bands of love.
Nothing could be more poetical than the life of Perseus. When he
went to destroy the dreadful Gorgon, Medusa, Pluto lent him his
helmet, which would make him invisible at will; Minerva loaned
her buckler, impenetrable, and polished like a mirror; Mercury
gave him a dagger of diamonds, and his winged sandals, which would
carry him through the air. Coming to the loathsome thing, he would
not look upon her, lest he, too, be turned to stone; but, guided
by the reflection in the buckler, smote off her head, carried it
high over Libya, the dropping blood turning to serpents, which
have infested those deserts ever since.

<p class="indent">
The human mind has always been ready to deify and throne in the
skies the heroes that labor for others. Both Perseus and Hercules
are divine by one parent, and human by the other. They go up and
down the earth, giving deliverance to captives, and breaking every
yoke. They also seek to purge away all evil; they slay dragons,
gorgons, devouring monsters, cleanse the foul places of earth,
and one of them so wrestles with death as to win a victim from his
grasp. Finally, by

an ascension in light, they go up to be in light forever. They
are not ideally perfect. They right wrong by slaying wrong-doers,
rather than by being crucified themselves; they are just murderers;
but that only plucks the fruit from the tree of evil. They never
attempted to infuse a holy life. They punished rather than regenerated.
It must be confessed, also, that they were not sinless. But they
were the best saviors the race could imagine, and are examples
of that perpetual effort of the human mind to incarnate a Divine
Helper who shall labor and die for the good of men.

<h3><i>Equatorial Constellations.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
If we turn our backs on Polaris on the 10th of November, at 10
o'clock in the evening, and look directly overhead, we shall see
the beautiful constellation of Andromeda. Together with the square
of Pegasus, it makes another enormous dipper. The star &alpha;
Alpheratz is in her face, the three at the left cross her breast.
&beta; and the two above mark the girdle of her loins, and &gamma;
is in the foot. Perseus is near enough for help; and Cetus, the
sea-monster, is far enough away to do no harm. Below, and east of
Andromeda, is the Ram of the golden fleece, recognizable by the
three stars in an acute triangle. The brightest is called Arietis,
or Hamel. East of this are the Pleiades, and the V-shaped Hyades
in Taurus, or the Bull. The Pleiades rise about 9 o'clock on the
evening of the 10th of September, and at 3 o'clock A.M. on June
10th.

Note the triangle, 26&deg; on a side, made by Betelguese, Sirius,
and Procyon. A line from Procyon to Pollux leads quite near to
Polaris. Orion is the mighty hunter. Under his feet is a hare,
behind him are two dogs, and before him is the rushing bull. The
curve of stars to the right of Bellatrix, &gamma;, represents his
shield of the Nemean lion's hide. The three stars of his belt make
a measure 3&deg; long; the upper one, Mintaker, is less than 30'
south of the equinoctial. The ecliptic passes between Aldebaran
and the Pleiades. Sirius rises about 9 o'clock P.M. on the 1st of
December, and about 4 o'clock A.M. on the 16th of August. Procyon
rises about half an hour earlier.

west of Hercules, and coiled round nearly to Aquila, is very traceable.
In the right-hand lower corner is the Centaur. Below, and always

<h3><i>Characteristics of the Stars.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
Such a superficial examination of stars as we have made scarcely
touches the subject. It is as the study of the baptismal register,
where the names were anciently recorded, without any knowledge
of individuals. The heavens signify much more to us than to the
Greeks. We revolve under a dome that investigation has infinitely
enlarged from their estimate. Their little lights were turned by
clumsy machinery, held together by material connections. Our vast
worlds are connected by a force so fine that it seems to pass out
of the realm of the material into that of the spiritual. Animal
ferocity or a human Hercules could image their idea of power. Ours
finds no symbol, but rises to the Almighty. Their heavens were full
of fighting Orions, wild bulls, chained Andromedas, and devouring
monsters. Our heavens are significant of harmony and unity; all
worlds carried by one force, and all harmonized into perfect music.
All their voices blend their various significations into a personal
speaking, which says, "Hast thou not heard that the everlasting
God, the Lord, the creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not,
neither is weary?" There is no searching of his understanding.
Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created all these
things, that brought out their host by number, that calleth them
all by their names in the greatness of his power; for that he is
strong in power not one faileth.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="page 210"><span class="page">Page 210</span></a>
<i>Number.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
We find about five thousand stars visible to the naked eye in the
whole heavens, both north and south. Of these twenty are of the
first magnitude, sixty-five of the second, two hundred of the third,
four hundred of the fourth, eleven hundred of the fifth, and three
thousand two hundred of the sixth. We think we can easily number
the stars; but train a six-inch telescope on a little section of the
Twins, where six faint stars are visible, and over three thousand
luminous points appear. The seventh magnitude has 13,000 stars; the
eighth, 40,000; the ninth, 142,000. There are 18,000,000 stars in
the zone called the Milky Way. When our eyes are not sensitive enough
to be affected by the light of far-off stars the tastimetre feels
their heat, and tells us the word of their Maker is true&mdash;"they
are innumerable."[*]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[Footnote *: <i>Telescopic Work.</i>&mdash;Look at the Hyades and
Pleiades in Taurus. Notice the different colors of stars in them
both. Find the cluster Pr&aelig;sepe in Fig. 70, just a trifle
above a point midway between Procyon and Regulus. It is equally
distant from Procyon and a point a little below Pollux. Sweep along
the Milky Way almost anywhere, and observe the distribution of stars;
in some places perfect crowds, in others more sparsely scattered.
Find with the naked eye the rich cluster in Perseus. Draw a line
from Algol to &alpha; of Perseus (Fig. 67); turn at right angles to
the right, at a distance of once and four-tenths the first line a
brightness will be seen. The telescope reveals a gorgeous cluster.]
</p>

<h3><i>Double and Multiple Stars.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
If we look up during the summer months nearly overhead at the star
&epsilon; Lyra, east of Vega (Fig. 72), we shall see with the naked
eye that the star appears a little
<a name="page 211"><span class="page">Page 211</span></a>
elongated. Turn your opera-glass upon it, and two stars appear. Turn
a larger telescope on this double star, and each of the components
separate into two. It is a double double star. We know that if
two stars are near in reality, and not simply apparently so by
being in the same line of sight, they must revolve around a common
centre of gravity, or rush to a common ruin. Eagerly we watch to
see if they revolve. A few years suffice to show them in actual
revolution. Nay, the movement of revolution has been decided before
the companion star was discovered. Sirius has long been known to
have a proper motion, such as it would have if another sun were
revolving about it. Even the direction of the unseen body could
always be indicated. In February, 1862, Alvan Clark, artist, poet,
and maker of telescopes (which requires even greater genius than to
be both poet and artist), discovered the companion of Sirius just
in its predicted place. As a matter of fact, one of Mr. Clark's
sons saw it first; but their fame is one. The time of revolution
of this pair is fifty years. But one companion does not meet the
conditions of the movements. Here must also be one or more planets
too small or dark to be seen. The double star &xi; in the Great
Bear (see Fig. 70) makes a revolution in fifty-eight years.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Procyon moves in an orbit which requires the presence of a companion
star, but it has as yet eluded our search. Castor is a double star;
but a third star or planet, as yet undiscovered, is required to
account for its perturbations. Men who discovered Neptune by the
perturbations of Uranus are capable of judging the cause of the
perturbations of suns. We have spoken of
<a name="page 212"><span class="page">Page 212</span></a>
the whole orbit of the earth being invisible from the stars. The
nearest star in our northern hemisphere, 61 Cygni, is a telescopic
double star; the constituent parts of it are forty-five times as
far from each other as the earth is from the sun, yet it takes
a large telescope to show any distance between the stars.[*]

be laid out here as can be done by small telescopes of from two

When &gamma; Virginis was observed in 1718 by Bradley, the component
parts were 7" asunder. He incidentally remarked in his note-book that
the line of their connection was parallel to the line of the two
stars Spica, or &alpha; and &delta; Virginis. By 1840 they were not
more than 1" apart, and the line of their connection greatly changed.
The appearance of the star is given in Fig. 75 (15), commencing at
the left, for the years 1837 '38 '39 '40 '45 '50 '60 and '79. also

Fig. 75.&mdash;Aspects and Revolution of Double Stars.
</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">
The meaning of these double stars is that two or more suns revolve
about their centre of gravity, as the moon and earth about their
centre. If they have planets, as doubtless they have, the movement
is no more complicated than the planets we call satellites of Saturn
revolving about their central body, and also about the sun. Kindle
Saturn and Jupiter to a blaze, or let out their possible light, and
our system would appear a triple star in the distance. Doubtless,
in the far past, before these giant planets were cooled, it so
appeared.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We find some stars double, others triple, quadruple, octuple, and
multiple. It is an extension of the same principles that govern
our system. Some of these suns are so far asunder that they can
swing their Neptunes between them, with less perturbation than
Uranus and Neptune have in ours. Light all our planets, and there
would be a multiple star with more or less suns seen,
<a name="page 214"><span class="page">Page 214</span></a>
according to the power of the instrument. Perhaps the octuple star
&sigma; in Orion differs in no respect from our system, except in
the size and distance of its separate bodies, and less cooling,
either from being younger, or from the larger bodies cooling more
slowly. Suns are of all ages. Infinite variety fills the sky. It
is as preposterous to expect that every system or world should
have analogous circumstances to ours at the present time, as to
insist that every member of a family should be of the same age,
and in the same state of development. There are worlds that have
not yet reached the conditions of habitability by men, and worlds
that have passed these conditions long since. Let them go. There are
enough left, and an infinite number in the course of preparation.
Some are fine and lasting enough to be eternal mansions.
</p>

<h3><i>Colored Stars.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
In the cloudy morning we get only red light, but the sun is white.
So Aldebaran and Betelguese may be girt by vapors, that only the
strong red rays can pass. Again, an iron moderately heated gives
out dull red light; becoming hotter, it emits white light. Sirius,
Regulus, Vega, and Spica may be white from greater intensity of
vibration. Procyon, Capella, and Polaris are yellow from less intensity
of vibration. Again, burn salt in a white flame, and it turns to
yellow; mix alcohol and boracic acid, ignite them, and a beautiful
green flame results; alcohol and nitrate of strontia give red flame;
alcohol and nitrate of barytes give yellow flame. So the composition
of a sun, or the special development of anyone substance thereof
at any time, may determine the color of a star.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 215"><span class="page">Page 215</span></a>
The special glory of color in the stars is seen in the marked contrasts
presented in the double and multiple stars. The larger star is
usually white, still in the intensity of heat and vibration; the
others, smaller, are somewhat cooled off, and hence present colors
lower down the scale of vibration, as green, yellow, orange, and
even red.
</p>

<p class="indent">
That stars should change color is most natural. Many causes would
produce this effect. The ancients said Sirius was red. It is now
white. The change that would most naturally follow mere age and
cooling would be from white, through various colors, to red. We are
charmed with the variegated flowers of our gardens of earth, but
he who makes the fields blush with flowers under the warm kisses of
the sun has planted his wider gardens of space with colored stars.
"The rainbow flowers of the footstool, and the starry flowers of
the throne," proclaim one being as the author of them all.
</p>

<h3><i>Clusters of Stars.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
From double and multiple we naturally come to groups and clusters.
Allusion has been made to the Hyades, Pleiades, etc. Everyone has
noticed the Milky Way. It seems like two irregular streams of compacted
stars. It is not supposed that they are necessarily nearer together
than the stars in the sparse regions about the pole. But the 18,000,000
suns belonging to our system are arranged within a space represented
by a flattened disk. If one hundred lights, three inches apart,
are arranged on a hoop ten feet in diameter, they would be in a
circle. Add a thousand or two more the same distance apart, filling
up the centre, and
<a name="page 216"><span class="page">Page 216</span></a>
extending a few inches on each side of the inner plane of the hoop:
an eye in the centre, looking out toward the edge, would see a
milky way of lights; looking out toward the sides or poles, would

<br />

</span>
</span>

see comparatively few. It would seem as if this oblate spheroidal
arrangement was the result of a revolution of all the suns composing
the system. Jupiter and earth are flattened at the poles for the
same reason.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In various parts of the heavens there are small globular well-defined
clusters, and clusters very irregular in form, marked with sprays
of stars. There is a cluster of this latter class in Hercules,
just under the S, in Fig. 72. "Probably no one ever saw it with

<span style="float: left; width: 100%; text-align: center; margin: 1em;">
<span style="font-size: smaller;">

<br />
Fig. 77.&mdash;Globular Cluster.
</span>
</span>

a good telescope without a shout of wonder." Here is a cluster
of the former class represented in Fig. 77. "The noble globular
cluster, &omega; Centauri is beyond all comparison the richest and
largest object of the kind in the heavens. Its stars are literally
innumerable; and as their total light, when received by the naked
eye, affects it hardly more than a star of the fifth to fourth
<a name="page 217"><span class="page">Page 217</span></a>
magnitude, the minuteness of each star may be imagined."
</p>

<p class="indent">
There are two possibilities of thought concerning these clusters.
Either that they belong to our stellar system, and hence the stars
must be small and young, or they are another universe of millions
of suns, so far way that the inconceivable distances between the
stars are shrunken to a hand's-breadth, and their unbearable splendor
of innumerable suns can only make a gray haze at the distance at
which we behold them. The latter is the older and grander thought;
the former the newer and better substantiated.
</p>

<h3><i>Nebul&aelig;.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
The gorgeous clusters we have been considering appear to the eye
or the small telescope as little cloudlets of hazy light. One after
another were resolved into stars; and the natural conclusion was,
that all would yield and reveal themselves to be clustered suns,
when we had telescopes of sufficient power. But the spectroscope,
seeing not merely form but substance also, shows that some of them
are not stars in any sense, but masses of glowing gas. Two of these
nebul&aelig; are visible to the naked eye: one in Andromeda (see
Fig. 68), and one around the middle star of the sword of Orion,
shown in Fig.78. A three-inch telescope resolves &theta; Orionis
into the famous trapezium, and a nine-inch instrument sees two stars
more. The shape of the nebula is changeable, and is hardly suggestive
of the moulding influence of gravitation. It is probably composed
of glowing nitrogen and hydrogen gases. Nebul&aelig; are of all
conceivable shapes&mdash;circular, annular, oval, lenticular,
<a name="page 218"><span class="page">Page 218</span></a>
conical, spiral, snake-like, looped, and nameless. Compare the
sprays of the Crab nebul&aelig; above &zeta; Tauri, seen in Fig.
79, and the ring nebula, Fig. 80. This last possibly consists of
stars, and is situated, as shown in Fig. 81, midway between &beta;
and &gamma; Lyr&aelig;.

<p class="indent">
When Herschel was sweeping the heavens with his telescope, and
saw but few stars, he often said to his assistant, "Prepare to
write; the nebul&aelig; are coming." They are most abundant where
the stars are least so. A zone about the heavens 30&deg; wide,
with the Milky Way in the centre, would include one-fourth of the
celestial sphere; but instead of one-fourth, we find nine-tenths
<a name="page 219"><span class="page">Page 219</span></a>
of the stars in this zone, and but one-tenth of the nebul&aelig;.
</p>

<p class="indent">
These immense masses of unorganized matter are noticed to change
their forms, vary their light greatly, but not quickly; they change
through the ages. "God works slowly." He takes a thousand years
to lift his hand off.

Whether they belong to our system, or are beyond it, is not settled;

<p class="indent">
Our sun gives a variable amount of light, changing through a period
of eleven years. Probably every star, if examined by methods
sufficiently delicate and exact, would be found to be variable.
The variations of some
<a name="page 221"><span class="page">Page 221</span></a>
stars are so marked as to challenge investigation. &beta; Lyr&aelig;
(Fig. 81) has two maxima and minima of light. In three days it
rises from magnitude 4-1/2 to 3-1/2; in a week falls to 4, and
rises to 3-1/2; and in three days more drops to 4-1/2: it makes
all these changes in thirteen days; but this period is constantly
increasing. The variations of one hundred and forty-three stars
have been well ascertained.

<p class="indent">
Mira, or the Wonderful, in the Whale (Fig. 68), is easily found when
visible. Align from Capella to the Pleiades, and as much farther,
and four stars will be seen, situated thus:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
</tt>
</p>

<p class="indent">
The right-hand one is Mira. For half a month it shines as a star
of the second magnitude. Then for three months it fades away, and
lost to sight; going down even to the eleventh magnitude. But after
five months its resurrection morning mes; and in three months
more&mdash;eleven months in all&mdash;our Wonderful is in its full
glory in the heavens. It its period and brilliancy are also variable.
The star Megrez, &delta; in the Great Bear, has been growing dim
<a name="page 222"><span class="page">Page 222</span></a>
for a century. In 1836 Betelguese was exceedingly variable, and
continued so till 1840, when the changes became much less conspicuous.
Algol (Fig. 68) has been already referred to. This slowly winking
eye is of the second magnitude during 2d. 14h. Then it dozes off
toward sleep for 4h. 24m., when it is nearly invisible. It wakes
up during the same time; so that its period from maximum brilliancy
to the same state again is 2d. 20h. 48m. Its recognizable changes
are within five or six hours. As I write, March 25th, 1879, Algol
gives its minimum light at 9h. 36m. P.M. It passes fifteen minima
in 43d. 13m. There will therefore be another minimum May 7th, at
9h. 49m. Its future periods are easy to estimate. Perhaps it has
some dark body revolving about it at frightful speed, in a period
of less than three days. The period of its variability is growing
shorter at an increasing rate. If its variability is caused by a
dark body revolving about it, the orbit of that body is contracting,
and the huge satellite will soon, as celestial periods are reckoned,
commence to graze the surface of the sun itself, rebound again and
again, and at length plunge itself into the central fire. Such an
event would evolve heat enough to make Algol flame up into a star
of the first magnitude, and perhaps out-blaze Sirius or Capella
in our winter sky.
</p>

<p class="indent">
None of the causes for these changes we have been able to conjecture
seem very satisfactory. The stars may have opaque planets revolving
about them, shutting off their light; they may rotate, and have
unequally illuminated sides; they may revolve in very elliptical
orbits, so as to greatly alter their distance from us; they may
be so situated in regard to zones of meteorites as
<a name="page 223"><span class="page">Page 223</span></a>
to call down periodically vast showers; but none or all of these
suppositions apply to all cases, if they do to any.
</p>

<h3><i>Temporary, New, and Lost Stars.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
Besides regular movements to right and left, up and down, to and
from us&mdash;changes in the intensity of illumination by changes
of distance&mdash;besides variations occurring at regular and
ascertainable intervals, there are stars called <i>temporary</i>,
shining awhile and then disappearing; <i>new</i>, coming to a definite
brightness, and so remaining; and <i>lost</i>, those whose first
appearance was not observed, but which have utterly disappeared.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In November, 1572, a new star blazed out in Cassiopeia. Its place
is shown in Fig. 67, &chi; &gamma; being the stars
</p>

<p class="bquote">
<tt>
&delta;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />
&nbsp;&gamma;&nbsp;&chi;
</tt>
</p>

<p>
in the seat of the chair, and &delta; being the first one in the
back. This star was visible at noonday, and was brighter than any
other star in the heavens. In January, 1573, it was less bright
than Jupiter; in April it was below the second magnitude, and the
last of May it utterly disappeared. It was as variable in color as
in brilliancy. During its first two months, the period of greatest
brightness, it was dazzling white, then became yellow, and finally
as red as Mars or Aldebaran, and so expired.
</p>

<p class="indent">
A bright star was seen very near to the place of the <i>Pilgrim</i>,
as the star of 1572 was called, in A.D. 945 and 1264. A star of
the tenth magnitude is now seen brightening slowly almost exactly
in the same place. It is possible that this is a variable star
of a period of about three hundred and ten years, and will blaze
out again about 1885.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But we have had, within a few years, fine opportunities
<a name="page 224"><span class="page">Page 224</span></a>
to study, with improved instruments, two new stars; On the evening
of May 12th, 1866, a star of the second magnitude was observed in
the Northern Crown, where no star above the fifth magnitude had
been twenty-four hours before. In Argelander's chart a star of
the tenth magnitude occupies the place. May 13th it had declined
to the third magnitude, May 16th to the fourth, May 17th to the
fifth, May 19th to the seventh, May 31st to the ninth, and has
since diminished to the tenth. The spectroscope showed it to be a
star in the usual condition; but through the usual colored spectrum,
crossed with bright lines, shone four bright lines, two of which
indicated glowing hydrogen. Here was plenty of proof that an unusual
amount of this gas had given this sun its sudden flame. As the
hydrogen burned out the star grew dim.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Two theories immediately presented themselves: First, that vast
volumes had been liberated from within the orb by some sudden breaking
up of the doors of its great deeps; or, second, this star had
precipitated upon itself, by attraction, some other sun or planet,
the force of whose impact had been changed into heat.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Though we see the liberated hydrogen of our sun burst up with sudden
flame, it can hardly be supposed that enough could be liberated
at once to increase the light and heat one hundred-fold.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In regard to the second theory, it is capable of proof that two
suns half as large as ours, moving at a velocity of four hundred
and seventy-six miles per second, would evolve heat enough to supply
the radiation of our sun for fifty million years. How could it be
possible for a sun like this newly blazing orb to cool off to such a
<a name="page 225"><span class="page">Page 225</span></a>
degree in a month? Besides, there would not be one chance in a
thousand for two orbs to come directly together. They would revolve
about each other till a kind of grazing contact of grinding worlds
would slowly kindle the ultimate heat.
</p>

<p class="indent">
It is far more likely that this star encountered an enormous stream
of meteoric bodies, or perhaps absorbed a whole comet, that laid
its million leagues of tail as fuel on the central fire. Only let
it be remembered that the fuel is far more force than substance.
Allusion has already been made to the sudden brightening of our
sun on the first day of September, 1859. That was caused, no doubt,
by the fall of large meteors, following in the train of the comet
of 1843, or some other comet. What the effect would have been, had
the whole mass of the comet been absorbed, cannot be imagined.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Another new star lately appeared in Cygnus, near the famous star
61&mdash;the first star in the northern hemisphere whose distance
was determined. It was first seen November 24th, 1876, as a third
magnitude star of a yellow color. By December 2d it had sunk to
the fourth magnitude, and changed to a greenish color. It had then
three bright hydrogen lines, the strong double sodium line, and
others, which made, it strongly resemble the spectrum of the
chromosphere of our sun. An entirely different result appeared
in the fading of these two stars. In the case of the star in the
Crown, the extraordinary light was the first to fade, leaving the
usual stellar spectrum. In the case of the star in Cygnus, the
part of the spectrum belonging to stellar light was the first to
fade, leaving the bright lines; that is, the gas of one gave way
to regular starlight, and the starlight
<a name="page 226"><span class="page">Page 226</span></a>
of the other having faded, the regular light of the glowing gas
continued. By some strange oversight, no one studied the star again
for six months. In September and November, 1877, the light of this
star was found to be blue, and not to be starlight at all. It had no
rainbow spectrum, only one kind of rays, and hence only one color.
Its sole spectroscopic line is believed to be that of glowing nitrogen
gas. We have then, probably, in the star of 1876, a body shining
by a feeble and undiscernible light, surrounded by a discernible
immensity of light of nitrogen gas. This is its usual condition;
but if a flight of meteors should raise the heat of the central
body so as to outshine the nebulous envelope, we should have the
conditions we discovered in November, 1876. But a rapid cooling
dissipates the observable light of all colors, and leaves only
the glowing gas of one color.
</p>

<h3><i>Movements of Stars.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">
We call the stars <i>fixed</i>, but motion and life are necessary
to all things. Besides the motion in the line of sight described
already, there is motion in every other conceivable direction.
We knew Sirius moved before we had found the cause. We know that
our sun moves back and forth in his easy bed one-half his vast
diameter, as the larger planets combine their influence on one side
or the other.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The sun has another movement. We find the stars in Hercules gradually
spreading from each other. Hercules's brawny limbs grow brawnier
every century. There can be but one cause: we are approaching that
quarter of the heavens. (See <img src="images/earth.gif" width="16"
height="16" alt="Earth">, Fig. 72.) We are even
<a name="page 227"><span class="page">Page 227</span></a>
able to compute the velocity of our approach; it is four miles a
second. The stars in the opposite quarter of the heavens in Argo
are drawing nearer together.
</p>

<p class="indent">
This movement would have no effect on the apparent place of the
stars at either pole, if they were all equally distant; but it
must greatly extend or contract the apparent space between them,
since they are situated at various distances.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Independent of this, the stars themselves are all in motion, but so
vast is the distance from which we observe them that it has taken
an accumulation of centuries before they could be made measurable.
A train going forty miles an hour, seen from a distance of two
miles, almost seems to stand still. Arcturus moves through space
three times as fast as the earth, but it takes a century to appear
to move the eighth part of the diameter of the moon. There is a
star in the Hunting Dogs, known as 1830 Groombridge, which has a
velocity beyond what all the attraction of the matter of the known
universe could give it. By the year 9000 it may be in Berenice's
Hair.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Some stars have a common movement, being evidently related together.
A large proportion of the brighter stars between Aldebaran and
the Pleiades have a common motion eastward of about ten seconds a
century. All the angles marked by &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, &chi;
Orionis will be altered in different directions; &lambda; is moving
toward &gamma;. &lambda; and &epsilon; will appear as a double
star. In A.D. 50,000 Procyon will be nearer &chi; Orionis than
Rigel now is, and Sirius will be in line with &alpha; and &chi;
Orionis. All the stars of the Great Dipper, except Benetnasch and
Dubhe, have a common motion somewhat in the direction
<a name="page 228"><span class="page">Page 228</span></a>
of Thuban (Fig. 67), while the two named have a motion nearly opposite.
In 36,000 years the end of the Dipper will have fallen out so that
it will hold no water, and the handle will be broken square off at
Mizar. "The Southern Cross," says Humboldt, "will not always keep
its characteristic form, for its four stars travel in different
directions with unequal velocities. At the present time it is not
known how many myriads of years must elapse before its entire
dislocation."
</p>

<p class="indent">
These movements are not in fortuitous or chaotic ways, but are
doubtless in accordance with some perfect plan. We have climbed
up from revolving earth and moon to revolving planets and sun,
in order to understand how two or ten suns can revolve about a
common centre. Let us now leap to the grander idea that all the
innumerable stars of a winter night not only loan, but must revolve
about some centre of gravity. Men have been looking for a central
sun of suns, and have not found it. None is needed. Two suns can
balance about a point; all suns can swing about a common centre.
That one unmoving centre may be that city more gorgeous than Eastern
imagination ever conceived, whose pavement is transparent gold,
whose walls are precious stones, whose light is life, and where
no dark planetary bodies ever cast shadows. There reigns the King
and Lord of all, and ranged about are the far-off provinces of his
material systems. They all move in his sight, and receive power
from a mind that never wearies.

<p class="subtitle">
<i>THE WORLDS AND THE WORD.</i>
</p>

<p class="indent">
Men have found the various worlds to be far richer than they originally
thought. They have opened door after door in their vast treasuries,
have ascended throne after throne of power, and ruled realms of
increasing extent. We have no doubt that unfoldings in the future
will amaze even those whose expectations have been quickened by
the revealings of the past. What if it be found that the Word is
equally inexhaustible?
</p>

<p class="indent">
After ages of thought and discovery we have come out of the darkness
and misconceptions of men. We believe in no serpent, turtle, or
elephant supporting the world; no Atlas holding up the heavens;
no crystal domes, "with cycles and epicycles scribbled o'er." What
if it be found that one book, written by ignorant men, never fell
into these mistakes of the wisest! Nay, more, what if some of the
greatest triumphs of modern science are to be found plainly stated
in a book older than the writings of Homer? If suns, planets, and
satellites, with all their possibilities of life, changes of flora
and fauna, could be all provided for, as some scientists tell us,
in the fiery star-dust of a cloud, why may not the same Author
provide a perpetually widening river of life in his Word? As we
believe He is perpetually present in his worlds, we know He has
<a name="page 232"><span class="page">Page 232</span></a>
promised to be perpetually present in his Word, making it alive
with spirit and life.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The wise men of the past could not avoid alluding to ideas the falsity
of which subsequent discovery has revealed; but the writers of the
Bible did avoid such erroneous allusion. Of course they referred
to some things, as sunrise and sunset, according to appearance;
but our most scientific books do the same to-day. That the Bible
could avoid teaching the opposite of scientific truth proclaims
that a higher than human wisdom was in its teaching.
</p>

<p class="indent">
That negative argument is strong, but the affirmative argument is
much stronger. The Bible declares scientific truth far in advance
of its discovery, far in advance of man's ability to understand
its plain declarations. Take a few conspicuous illustrations:
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Bible asserted from the first that the present order of things
had a beginning. After ages of investigation, after researches in
the realms of physics, arguments in metaphysics, and conclusions
by the necessities of resistless logic, science has reached the
same result.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Bible asserted from the first that creation of matter preceded
arrangement. It was chaos&mdash;void&mdash;without form&mdash;darkness;
arrangement was a subsequent work. The world was not created in the
form it was to have; it was to be moulded, shaped, stratified,
coaled, mountained, valleyed, subsequently. All of which science
utters ages afterward.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The Bible did not hesitate to affirm that light existed before
the sun, though men did not believe it, and used it as a weapon
against inspiration. Now we praise men for having demonstrated
the oldest record.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 233"><span class="page">Page 233</span></a>
It is a recently discovered truth of science that the trata of
the earth were formed by the action of water, and the mountains
were once under the ocean. It is an idea long familiar to Bible
readers: "Thou coverest the earth with the deep as with a garment.
The waters stood above the mountains. At thy rebuke they fled; at
the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. The mountains ascend;
the valleys descend into the place thou hast founded for them."
Here is a whole volume of geology in a paragraph. The thunder of
continental convulsions is God's voice; the mountains rise by God's
power; the waters haste away unto the place God prepared for them.
Our slowness of geological discovery is perfectly accounted for
by Peter. "For of this they are <i>willingly ignorant</i>, that
by the word of God there were heavens of old, and land framed out
of water, and by means of water, whereby the world that then was,
being overflowed by water, perished." We recognize these geological
subsidences, but we read them from the testimony of the rocks more
willingly than from the testimony of the Word.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Science exults in having discovered what it is pleased to call
an order of development on earth&mdash;tender grass, herb, tree;
moving creatures that have life in the waters; bird, reptile, beast,
cattle, man. The Bible gives the same order ages before, and calls
it God's successive creations.
</p>

<p class="indent">
During ages on ages man's wisdom held the earth to be flat. Meanwhile,
God was saying, century after century, of himself, "He sitteth upon
the sphere of the earth" (Gesenius).
</p>

<p class="indent">
Men racked their feeble wits for expedients to uphold
<a name="page 234"><span class="page">Page 234</span></a>
the earth, and the best they could devise were serpents, elephants,
and turtles; beyond that no one had ever gone to see what supported
them. Meanwhile, God was perpetually telling men that he had hung
the earth upon nothing.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Men were ever trying to number the stars. Hipparchus counted one
thousand and twenty-two; Ptolemy one thousand and twenty-six; and
it is easy to number those visible to the naked eye. But the Bible
said, when there were no telescopes to make it known, that they were
as the sands of the sea, "innumerable." Science has appliances of
enumeration unknown to other ages, but the space-penetrating telescopes
and tastimeters reveal more worlds&mdash;eighteen millions in a
single system, and systems beyond count&mdash;till men acknowledge
that the stars are innumerable to man. It is God's prerogative "to
number all the stars; he also calleth them all by their names."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Torricelli's discovery that the air had weight was received with
incredulity. For ages the air had propelled ships, thrust itself
against the bodies of men, and overturned their works. But no man
ever dreamed that weight was necessary to give momentum. During
all the centuries it had stood in the Bible, waiting for man's
comprehension: "He gave to the air its weight" (Job xxviii. 25).
</p>

<p class="indent">
The pet science of to-day is meteorology. The fluctuations and
variations of the weather have hitherto baffled all attempts at
unravelling them. It has seemed that there was no law in their
fickle changes. But at length perseverance and skill have triumphed,
and a single man in one place predicts the weather and winds
<a name="page 235"><span class="page">Page 235</span></a>
for a continent. But the Bible has always insisted that the whole
department was under law; nay, it laid down that law so clearly,
that if men had been willing to learn from it they might have reached
this wisdom ages ago. The whole moral law is not more clearly
crystallized in "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and thy neighbor as thyself," than all the fundamentals of
the science of meteorology are crystallized in these words: "The
wind goeth toward the south (equator), and turneth about (up) unto
the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth
again according to his circuits (established routes). All the rivers
run into the sea; yet the sea is not full: unto the place from
whence the rivers come, thither they return again" (Eccles. i. 6,
7).
</p>

<p class="indent">
Those scientific queries which God propounded to Job were unanswerable
then; most of them are so now. "Whereon are the sockets of the
earth made to sink?" Job never knew the earth turned in sockets;
much less could he tell where they were fixed. God answered this
question elsewhere. "He stretcheth the north (one socket) over
the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing." Speaking of
the day-spring, God says the earth is <i>turned</i> to it, as clay
to the seal. The earth's axial revolution is clearly recognized.
Copernicus declared it early; God earlier.
</p>

<p class="indent">
No man yet understands the balancing of the clouds, nor the suspension
of the frozen masses of hail, any more than Job did.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Had God asked if he had perceived the <i>length</i> of the earth,
many a man to-day could have answered yes. But the eternal ice
keeps us from perceiving the <i>breadth</i>
<a name="page 236"><span class="page">Page 236</span></a>
of the earth, and shows the discriminating wisdom of the question.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The statement that the sun's going is from the end of the heaven,
and his circuit to the ends of it, has given edge to many a sneer
at its supposed assertion that the sun went round the earth. It
teaches a higher truth&mdash;that the sun itself obeys the law it
enforces on the planets, and flies in an orbit of its own, from
one end of heaven in Argo to the other in Hercules.
</p>

<p class="indent">
So eminent an astronomer and so true a Christian as General Mitchell,
who understood the voices in which the heavens declare the glory of
God, who read with delight the Word of God em bodied in worlds, and
who fed upon the written Word of God as his daily bread, declared,
"We find an aptness and propriety in all these astronomical
illustrations, which are not weakened, but amazingly strengthened,
when viewed in the clear light of our present knowledge." Herschel
says, "All human discoveries seem to be made only for the purpose
of confirming more strongly the truths that come from on high, and
are contained in the sacred writings." The common authorship of
the worlds and the Word becomes apparent; their common unexplorable
wealth is a necessary conclusion.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Since the opening revelations of the past show an unsearchable
wisdom in the Word, has that Word any prophecy concerning mysteries
not yet understood, and events yet in the future? There are certain
problems as yet insolvable. We have grasped many clews, and followed
them far into labyrinths of darkness, but not yet through into
light.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We ask in vain, "What is matter?" No man can
<a name="page 237"><span class="page">Page 237</span></a>
answer. We trace it up through the worlds, till its increasing
fineness, its growing power, and possible identity of substance,
seem as if the next step would reveal its spirit origin. What we
but hesitatingly stammer, the Word boldly asserts.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We ask, "What is force?" No man can answer. We recognize its various
grades, each subordinate to the higher&mdash;cohesion dissolvable
by heat; the affinity of oxygen and hydrogen in water overcome by
the piercing intensity of electric fire; rivers seeking the sea
by gravitation carried back by the sun; rock turned to soil, soil
to flowers; and all the forces in nature measurably subservient
to mind. Hence we partly understand what the Word has always taught
us, that all lower forces must be subject to that which is highest.
How easily can seas be divided, iron made to swim, water to burn,
and a dead body to live again, if the highest force exert itself
over forces made to be mastered. When we have followed force to
its highest place, we always find ourselves considering the forces
of mind and spirit, and say, in the words of the Scriptures, "God
is spirit."
</p>

<p class="indent">
We ask in vain what is the end of the present condition of things.
We have read the history of our globe with great difficulty&mdash;its
prophecy is still more difficult. We have asked whether the stars
form a system, and if so, whether that system is permanent. We
are not able to answer yet. We have said that the sun would in
time become as icy cold and dead as the moon, and then the earth
would wander darkling in the voids of space. But the end of the
earth, as prophesied in the Word, is different: "The heavens will
pass away with
<a name="page 238"><span class="page">Page 238</span></a>
a rushing noise, and the elements will be dissolved with burning
heat, and the earth and the works therein will be burned up." The
latest conclusions of science point the same way. The great zones
of uncondensed matter about the sun seem to constitute a resisting
medium as far as they reach. Encke's comet, whose orbit comes near
the sun, is delayed. This gives gravitation an overwhelming power,
and hence the orbit is lessened and a revolution accomplished more
quickly. Faye's comet, which wheels beyond the track of Mars, is
not retarded. If the earth moves through a resisting substance,
its ultimate fall into the sun is certain. Whether in that far
future the sun shall have cooled off, or will be still as hot as
to-day, Peter's description would admirably portray the result of
the impact. Peters description, however, seems rather to indicate an
interference of Divine power at an appropriate time before a running
down of the system at present in existence, and a re-endowment of
matter with new capabilities.
</p>

<p class="indent">
After thousands of years, science discovered the true way to knowledge.
It is the Baconian way of experiment, of trial, of examining the
actual, instead of imagining the ideal. It is the acceptance of the
Scriptural plan. "If a man wills to do God's will, he shall know."
Oh taste and see! In science men try hypotheses, think the best they
can, plan broadly as possible, and then see if facts sustain the
theory. They have adopted the Scriptural idea of accepting a plan,
and then working in faith, in order to acquire knowledge. Fortunately,
in the work of salvation the plan is always perfect. But, in order
to make the trial under the most favorable circumstances, there
must be faith. The faith of
<a name="page 239"><span class="page">Page 239</span></a>
science is amazing; its assertions of the supersensual are astounding.
It affirms a thousand things that cannot be physically demonstrated:
that the flight of a rifle-ball is parabolic; that the earth has
poles; that gages are made of particles; that there are atoms;
that an electric light gives ten times as many rays as are visible;
that there are sounds to which we are deaf, sights to which we
are blind; that a thousand objects and activities are about us,
for the perception of which we need a hundred senses instead of
five. These faiths have nearly all led to sight; they have been
rewarded, and the world's wealth of knowledge is the result. The
Word has ever asserted the supersensuous, solicited man's faith,
and ever uplifted every true faith into sight. Lowell is partly
right when he sings:
</p>

<p class="bquote">
"Science was Faith once; Faith were science now,<br>
Would she but lay her bow and arrows by,<br>
And aim her with the weapons of the time."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Faith laid her bow and arrows by before men in pursuit of worldly
knowledge discovered theirs.
</p>

<p class="indent">
What becomes of the force of the sun that is being spent to-day?
It is one of the firmest rocks of science that there can be no
absolute destruction of force. It is all conserved somehow. But
how? The sun contracts, light results, and leaps swiftly into all
encircling space. It can never be returned. Heat from stars invisible
by the largest telescope enters the tastimeter, and declares that
that force has journeyed from its source through incalculable years.
There is no encircling dome to reflect all this force back upon
its sources. Is it lost? Science, in defence of its own dogma, should
<a name="page 240"><span class="page">Page 240</span></a>
assign light a work as it flies in the space which we have learned
cannot be empty. There ought to be a realm where light's inconceivable
energy is utilized in building a grander universe, where there is
no night. Christ said, as he went out of the seen into the unseen,
"I go to prepare a place for you;" and when John saw it in vision
the sun had disappeared, the moon was gone, but the light still
continued.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Science finds matter to be capable of unknown refinement; water
becomes steam full of amazing capabilities: we add more heat, superheat
the steam, and it takes on new aptitudes and uncontrollable energy.
Zinc burned in acid becomes electricity, which enters iron as a kind
of soul, to fill all that body with life. All matter is capable
of transformation, if not transfiguration, till it shines by the
light of an indwelling spirit. Scripture readers know that bodies
and even garments can be transfigured, be made
&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&rho;&alpha;&pi;&tau;&omega;&nu; (Luke xxiv.
4), shining with an inner light. They also look for new heavens
and a new earth endowed with higher powers, fit for perfect beings.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When God made matter, so far as our thought permits us to know,
he simply made force stationary and unconscious. Thereafter he
moves through it with his own will. He can at any time change these
forces, making air solid, water and rock gaseous, a world a cloud,
or a fire-mist a stone. He may at some time restore all force to
consciousness again, and make every part of the universe thrill
with responsive joy. "Then shall the mountains and the hills break
forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field clap
their hands." One of these changes is to come to the earth.
<a name="page 241"><span class="page">Page 241</span></a>
Amidst great noise the heaven shall flee, the earth be burned up,
and all their forces be changed to new forms. Perhaps it will not
then be visible to mortal eyes. Perhaps force will then be made
conscious, and the flowers thereafter return our love as much as
lower creatures do now. A river and tree of life may be consciously
alive, as well as give life. Poets that are nearest to God are
constantly hearing the sweet voices of responsive feeling in nature.
</p>

<p class="bquote">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For his gayer hours<br>
She has a voice of gladness and a smile,<br>
And eloquence of beauty; and she glides<br>
Into his darker musings with a mild<br>
And gentle sympathy, that steals away<br>
Their sharpness ere he is aware."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Prophets who utter God's voice of truth say, "The wilderness and
the solitary place shall be glad for holy men, and the desert shall
rejoice and blossom as the rose. It shall blossom abundantly and
rejoice, even with joy and singing."

<p class="indent">
Distinguish clearly between certainty and surmise. The certainty is
that the world will pass through catastrophic changes to a perfect
world. The grave of uniformitarianism is already covered with grass.
He that creates promises to complete. The invisible, imponderable,
inaudible ether is beyond our apprehension; it transmits impressions
186,000 miles a second; it is millions of times more capable and
energetic than air. What may be the bounds of its possibility none
can imagine, for law is not abrogated nor designs disregarded as
we ascend into higher realms. Law works out more beautiful designs
with more absolute certainty. Why
<a name="page 242"><span class="page">Page 242</span></a>
should there not be a finer universe than this, and disconnected
from this world altogether&mdash;a fit home for immortal souls?
It is a necessity.
</p>

<p class="indent">
God filleth all in all, is everywhere omnipotent and wise. Why
should there be great vacuities, barren of power and its creative
outgoings? God has fixed the stars as proofs of his agency at some
points in space. But is it in points only? Science is proud of its
discovery that what men once thought to be empty space is more
intensely active than the coarser forms of matter can be. But in
the long times which are past Job glanced at earth, seas, clouds,
pillars of heaven, stars, day, night, all visible things, and then
added: "Lo! these are only the outlying borders of his works. What
a whisper of a word we hear of <i>Him!</i> The thunder of his power
who can comprehend?"
</p>

<p class="indent">
Science discovers that man is adapted for mastery in this world.
He is of the highest order of visible creatures. Neither is it
possible to imagine an order of beings generically higher to be
connected with the conditions of the material world. This whole
secret was known to the author of the oldest writing. "And God
blessed them, and God said unto them: Be fruitful, and multiply,
and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every
living thing that moveth upon the earth." The idea is never lost
sight of in the sacred writings. And while every man knows he must
fail in one great contest, and yield himself to death, the later
portions of the divine Word offer him victory even here. The typical
man is commissioned to destroy even death, and make man a sharer
in the victory.
<a name="page 243"><span class="page">Page 243</span></a>
Science babbles at this great truth of man's position like a little
child; Scripture treats it with a breadth of perfect wisdom we
are only beginning to grasp.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Science tells us that each type is prophetic of a higher one. The
whale has bones prophetic of a human hand. Has man reached perfection?
Is there no prophecy in him? Not in his body, perhaps; but how his
whole soul yearns for greater beauty. As soon as he has found food,
the savage begins to carve his paddle, and make himself gorgeous with
feathers. How man yearns for strength, subduing animal and cosmic
forces to his will! How he fights against darkness and death, and
strives for perfection and holiness! These prophecies compel us to
believe there is a world where powers like those of electricity and
luminiferous ether are ever at hand; where its waters are rivers
of life, and its trees full of perfect healing, and from which all
unholiness is forever kept. What we infer, Scripture affirms.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Science tells us there has been a survival of the fittest. Doubtless
this is so. So in the future there will be a survival of the fittest.
What is it? Wisdom, gentleness, meekness, brotherly kindness, and
charity. Over those who have these traits death hath no permanent
power. The caterpillar has no fear as he weaves his own shroud; for
there is life within fit to survive, and ere long it spreads its
gorgeous wings, and flies in the air above where once it crawled. Man
has had two states of being already. One confined, dark, peculiarly
nourished, slightly conscious; then he was born into another&mdash;wide,
differently nourished, and intensely
<a name="page 244"><span class="page">Page 244</span></a>
conscious. He knows he may be born again into a life wider yet,
differently nourished, and even yet more intensely conscious. Science
has no hint how a long ascending series of developments crowned
by man may advance another step, and make man
&iota;&sigma;&alpha;&gamma;&gamma;&epsilon;&lambda;&omicron;&sigma;&mdash;equal
to angels. But the simplest teaching of Scripture points out a
way so clear that a child need not miss the glorious consummation.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When Uranus hastened in one part of its orbit, and then retarded,
and swung too wide, men said there must be another attracting world
beyond; and, looking there, Neptune was found. So, when individual
men are so strong that nations or armies cannot break down their
wills; so brave, that lions have no terrors; so holy, that temptation
cannot lure nor sin defile them; so grand in thought, that men
cannot follow; so pure in walk, that God walks with them&mdash;let
us infer an attracting world, high and pure and strong as heaven.
The eleventh chapter of Hebrews is a roll-call of heroes of whom
this world was not worthy. They were tortured, not accepting
deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection. The
world to come influenced, as it were, the orbits of their souls, and
when their bodies fell off, earth having no hold on them, they sped
on to their celestial home. The tendency of such souls necessitates
such a world.

The worlds and the Word speak but one language, teach but one set
of truths. How was it possible that the writers of the earlier
Scriptures described physical phenomena with wonderful sublimity,
and with such penetrative truth? They gazed upon the same heaven
that those men saw who ages afterward led the world in knowledge.
These latter were near-sighted, and absorbed
<a name="page 245"><span class="page">Page 245</span></a>
in the pictures on the first veil of matter; the former were
far-sighted, and penetrated a hundred strata of thickest material,
and saw the immaterial power behind. The one class studied the present,
and made the gravest mistakes; the other pierced the uncounted ages
of the past, and uttered the profoundest wisdom. There is but one
explanation. He that planned and made the worlds inspired the Word.

<p class="indent">
Science and religion are not two separate departments, they are
not even two phases of the same truth. Science has a broader realm
in the unseen than in the seen, in the source of power than in the
outcomes of power, in the sublime laws of spirit than in the laws
of matter; and religion sheds its beautiful light over all stages
of life, till, whether we eat or whether we drink, or whatsoever
we do, we may do all for the glory of God. Science and religion
make common confession that the great object of life is to learn
and to grow. Both will come to see the best possible means, for
the attainment of this end is a personal relation to a teacher
who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.

<p class="indent">
The universe is God's name writ large. Thought goes up the shining
suns as golden stairs, and reads the consecutive syllables&mdash;all
might, and wisdom, and beauty; and if the heart be fine enough and
pure enough, it also reads everywhere the mystic name of love. Let
us learn to read the hieroglyphics, and then turn to the blazonry
of the infinite page. That is the key-note; the heavens and the earth
declaring the glory of God, and men with souls attuned listening.
</p>

<p class="indent">
To what voices shall we listen first? Stand on the shore of a lake
set like an azure gem among the bosses of green hills. The patter
of rain means an annual fall of four cubic feet of water on every
square foot of it. It weighs two hundred and forty pounds to the
cubic foot, one hundred million tons on the surface of a little
sheet of water twenty miles long by three wide. Now, all that weight
of falling rain had to be lifted, a work compared to which taking
up mountains and casting them into the sea is pastime. All that
water had to be taken up before it could be cast down, and carried
hundreds of miles before it could be there. You have heard Niagara's
thunder; have stood beneath the falling immensity; seen it ceaselessly
poured from an infinite hand; felt that you would be ground to atoms
if you fell into that resistless flood. Well, all that infinity of
<a name="page 250"><span class="page">Page 250</span></a>
water had to be lifted by main force, had to be taken up out of the
far Pacific, brought over the Rocky Mountains; and the Mississippi
keeps bearing its wide miles of water to the Gulf, and Niagara
keeps thundering age after age, because there is power somewhere
to carry the immeasurable floods all the time the other way in
the upper air.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But this is only the Alpha of power. Professor Clark, of Amherst,
Massachusetts, found that such a soft and pulpy thing as a squash
had so great a power of growth that it lifted three thousand pounds,
and held it day and night for months. It toiled and grew under
the growing weight, compacting its substance like oak to do the
work. All over the earth this tremendous power and push of life
goes on&mdash;in the little star-eyed flowers that look up to God
only on the Alpine heights, in every tuft of grass, in every acre
of wheat, in every mile of prairie, and in every lofty tree that
wrestles with the tempests of one hundred winters. But this is
only the B in the alphabet of power.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Rise above the earth, and you find the worlds tossed like playthings,
and hurled seventy times as fast as a rifle-ball, never an inch
out of place or a second out of time. But this is only the C in
the alphabet of power.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Rise to the sun. It is a quenchless reservoir of high-class energy.
Our tornadoes move sixty miles an hour, those of the sun twenty
thousand miles an hour. A forest on fire sends its spires of flame
one hundred feet in air, the sun sends its spires of flame two
hundred thousand miles. All our fires exhaust the fuel and burn
out. If the sun were pure coal, it would burn out in five thousand
years; and yet this sea of unquenchable
<a name="page 251"><span class="page">Page 251</span></a>
flame seethes and burns, and rolls and vivifies a dozen worlds, and
flashes life along the starry spaces for a million years without
any apparent diminution. It sends out its power to every planet, in
the vast circle in which it lies. It fills with light not merely
a whole circle, but a dome; not merely a dome above, but one below,
and on every side. At our distance of ninety-two and a half millions
of miles, the great earth feels that power in gravitation, tides,
rains, winds, and all possible life&mdash;every part is full of
power. Fill the earth's orbit with a circle of such receptive
worlds&mdash;seventy thousand instead of one&mdash;everyone would
be as fully supplied with power from this central source. More.
Fill the whole dome, the entire extent of the surrounding sphere,
bottom, sides, top, a sphere one hundred and eighty-five million
miles in diameter, and everyone of these uncountable worlds would
be touched with the same power as one; each would thrill with life.
This is only the D of the alphabet of power. And glancing up to the
other suns, one hundred, five hundred, twelve hundred times as large,
double, triple, septuple, multiple suns, we shall find power enough
to go through the whole alphabet in geometrical ratio; and then in
the clustered suns, galaxies, and nebul&aelig;, power enough still
unrepresented by single letters to require all combinations of
the alphabet of power. What is the significance of this single
element of power? The answer of science to-day is "correlation,"
the constant evolution of one force from another. Heat is a mode
of motion, motion a result of heat. So far so good. But are we
mere reasoners in a circle? Then we would be lost men, treading our
round of death in a limitless forest. What is the ultimate? Reason
<a name="page 252"><span class="page">Page 252</span></a>
out in a straight line. No definition of matter allows it to originate
force; only mind can do that. Hence the ultimate force is always
mind. Carry your correlation as far as you please&mdash;through
planets, suns, nebul&aelig;, concretionary vortices, and revolving
fire-mist&mdash;there must always be mind and will beyond. Some of
that willpower that works without exhaustion must take its own force
and render it static, apparent. It may do this in such correlated
relation that that force shall go on year after year to a thousand
changing forms; but that force must originate in mind.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Go out in the falling rain, stand under the thunderous Niagara,
feel the immeasurable rush of life, see the hanging worlds, and
trace all this&mdash;the carried rain, the terrific thunder with
God's bow of peace upon it, and the unfailing planets hung upon
nothing&mdash;trace all this to the orb of day blazing in perpetual
strength, but stop not there. Who <i>made</i> the sun? Contrivance
fills all thought. <i>Who</i> made the sun? Nature says there is
a mind, and that mind is Almighty. Then you have read the first
syllables, viz., being and power.
</p>

<p class="indent">
What is the continuous relation of the universe to the mind from
which it derived its power? Some say that it is the relation of
a wound-up watch to the winder. It was dowered with sufficient
power to revolve its ceaseless changes, and its maker is henceforth
an absentee God. Is it? Let us have courage to see. For twenty
years one devotes ten seconds every night to putting a little force
into a watch. It is so arranged that it distributes that force
over twenty-four hours. In that twenty years more power has been
put into that watch than a horse could exert at once. But suppose
<a name="page 253"><span class="page">Page 253</span></a>
one had tried to put all that force into the watch at once: it
would have pulverized it to atoms. But supposing the universe had
been dowered with power at first to run its enormous rounds for
twenty millions of years. It is inconceivable; steel would be as
friable as sand, and strengthless as smoke, in such strain.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We have discovered some of the laws of the force we call gravitation.
But what do we know of its essence? How it appears to act we know a
little, what it is we are profoundly ignorant. Few men ever discuss
this question. All theories are sublimely ridiculous, and fail to
pass the most primary tests. How matter can act where it is not,
and on that with which it has no connection, is inconceivable.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Newton said that anyone who has in philosophical matters a competent
faculty of thinking, could not admit for a moment the possibility
of a sun reaching through millions of miles, and exercising there
an attractive power. A watch may run if wound up, but how the
watch-spring in one pocket can run the watch in another is hard
to see. A watch is a contrivance for distributing a force outside
of itself, and if the universe runs at all on that principle, it
distributes some force outside of itself.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Le Sage's theory of gravitation by the infinitive hail of atoms
cannot stand a minute, hence we come back as a necessity of thought
to Herschel's statement. "It is but reasonable to regard gravity
as a result of a consciousness and a will existent somewhere."
Where? I read an old book speaking of these matters, and it says
of God, He hangeth the earth upon nothing; he upholdeth constantly
all things by the word of his power.
<a name="page 254"><span class="page">Page 254</span></a>
By him all things consist or hold together. It teaches an imminent
mind; an almighty, constantly exerted power. Proof of this starts
up on every side. There is a recognized tendency in all high-class
energy to deteriorate to a lower class. There is steam in the boiler,
but it wastes without fuel. There is electricity in the jar, but
every particle of air steals away a little, unless our conscious
force is exerted to regather it. There is light in the sun, but
infinite space waits to receive it, and takes it swift as light
can leap. We said that if the sun were pure coal, it would burn
out in five thousand years, but it blazes undimmed by the million.
How can it? There have been various theories: chemical combustion,
it has failed; meteoric impact, it is insufficient; condensation,
it is not proved; and if it were, it is an intermediate step back
to the original cause of condensation. The far-seeing eyes see in
the sun the present active power of Him who first said, "Let there
be light," and who at any moment can meet a Saul in the way to
Damascus with a light above the brightness of the sun&mdash;another
noon arisen on mid-day; and of whom it shall be said in the eternal
state of unclouded brightness, where sun and moon are no more,
"The glory of the Lord shall lighten it, and the Lamb is the light
thereof."
</p>

<p class="indent">
But suppose matter could be dowered, that worlds could have a
gravitation, one of two things must follow: It must have conscious
knowledge of the position, exact weight, and distance of every
atom, mass, and world, in order to proportion the exact amount of
gravity, or it must fill infinity with an omnipresent attractive
power, pulling in myriads of places at nothing; in
<a name="page 255"><span class="page">Page 255</span></a>
a few places at worlds. Every world must exert an infinitely extended
power, but myriads of infinities cannot be in the same space. The
solution is, one infinite power and conscious will.
</p>

<p class="indent">
To see the impossibility of every other solution, join in the long
and microscopic hunt for the ultimate particle, the atom; and if
found, or if not found, to a consideration of its remarkable powers.
Bring telescopes and microscopes, use all strategy, for that atom
is difficult to catch. Make the first search with the microscope:
we can count 112,000 lines ruled on a glass plate inside of an
inch. But we are here looking at mountain ridges and valleys, not
atoms. Gold can be beaten to the 1/340000 of an inch. It can be
drawn as the coating of a wire a thousand times thinner, to the
1/340000000 of an inch. But the atoms are still heaped one upon
another.

<p class="indent">
Take some of the infusorial animals. Alonzo Gray says millions
of them would not equal in bulk a grain of sand. Yet each of them
performs the functions of respiration, circulation, digestion,
and locomotion. Some of our blood-vessels are not a millionth of
our size. What must be the size of the ultimate particles that
freely move about to nourish an animal whose totality is too small
to estimate? A grain of musk gives off atoms enough to scent every
part of the air of a room. You detect it above, below, on every
side. Then let the zephyrs of summer and the blasts of winter sweep
through that room for forty years, bearing out into the wide world
miles on miles of air, all perfumed from the atoms of that grain
of musk, and at the end of the forty years the weight of musk has
not appreciably diminished.
<a name="page 256"><span class="page">Page 256</span></a>
Yet uncountable myriads on myriads of atoms have gone.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Our atom is not found yet. Many are the ways of searching for it
which we cannot stop to consider. We will pass in review the properties
with which materialists preposterously endow it. It is impenetrable
and indivisible, though some atoms are a hundred times larger than
others. Each has definite shape; some one shape, and some another.
They differ in weight, in quantity of combining power, in quality
of combining power. They combine with different substances, in
certain exact assignable quantities. Thus one atom of hydrogen
combines with eighty of bromine, one hundred and sixty of mercury,
two hundred and forty of boron, three hundred and twenty of silicon,
etc. Hence our atom of hydrogen must have power to count, or at
least to measure, or be cognizant of bulk. Again, atoms are of
different sorts, as positive or negative to electric currents.
They have power to take different shapes with different atoms in
crystallization; that is, there is a power in them, conscious or
otherwise, that the same bricks shall make themselves into stables
or palaces, sewers or pavements, according as the mortar varies.
"No, no," you cry out; "it is only according as the builder varies
his plan." There is no need to rehearse these powers much further;
though not one-tenth of the supposed innate properties of this
infinitesimal infinite have been recited&mdash;properties which
are expressed by the words atomicity, quantivilence, monad, dryad,
univalent, perissad, quadrivalent, and twenty other terms, each
expressing some endowment of power in this in visible atom. Refer
to one more presumed ability, an ability
<a name="page 257"><span class="page">Page 257</span></a>
to keep themselves in exact relation of distance and power to each
other, without touching.

<p class="indent">
It is well known that water does not fill the space it occupies.
We can put eight or ten similar bulks of different substances into
a glass of water without greatly increasing its bulk, some actually
diminishing it. A philosopher has said that the atoms of oxygen
and hydrogen are probably not nearer to each other in water than
one hundred and fifty men would be if scattered over the surface
of England, one man to four hundred square miles.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The atoms of the luminiferous ether are infinitely more diffused,
and yet its interactive atoms can give four hundred millions of
light-waves a second. And now, more preposterous than all, each
atom has an attractive power for every other atom of the universe.
The little mote, visible only in a sunbeam streaming through a
dark room, and the atom, infinitely smaller, has a grasp upon the
whole world, the far-off sun, and the stars that people infinite
space. The Sage of Concord advises you to hitch your wagon to a
star. But this is hitching all stars to an infinitesimal part of
a wagon. Such an atom, so dowered, so infinite, so conscious, is
an impossible conception.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But if matter could be so dowered as to produce such results by
mechanism, could it be dowered to produce the results of intelligence?
Could it be dowered with power of choice without becoming mind?
If oxygen and hydrogen could be made able to combine into water,
could the same unformed matter produce in one case a plant, in
another a bird, in a third a man; and in each of these put bone,
brain, blood, and nerve in
<a name="page 258"><span class="page">Page 258</span></a>
proper relations? Matter must be mind, or subject to a present
working mind, to do this. There must be a present intelligence
directing the process, laying the dead bricks, marble, and wood in
an intelligent order for a living temple. If we do put God behind a
single veil in dead matter, in all living things he must be apparent
and at work. If, then, such a thing as an infinite atom is impossible,
shall we not best understand matter by saying it is a visible
representation of God's personal will and power, of his personal
force, and perhaps knowledge, set aside a little from himself, still
possessed somewhat of his personal attributes, still responsive
to his will. What we call matter may be best understood as God's
force, will, knowledge, rendered apparent, static, and unweariably
operative. Unless matter is eternal, which is unthinkable, there
was nothing out of which the world could be made, but God himself;
and, reverently be it said, matter seems to retain fit capabilities
for such source. Is not this the teaching of the Bible? I come to
the old Book. I come to that man who was taken up into the arcana
of the third heaven, the holy of holies, and heard things impossible
to word. I find he makes a clear, unequivocal statement of this
truth as God's revelation to him. "By faith," says the author of
Hebrews, "we understand the worlds were framed by the word of God,
so that things which are seen were not made of things which do
appear." In Corinthians, Paul says&mdash;But to us there is but
one God, the Father, of whom [as a source] are all things; and one
Lord Jesus Christ, by whom [as a creative worker] are all things.
So in Romans he says&mdash;"For out of him, and through him, and
to him are all things, to whom be glory forever. Amen."
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 259"><span class="page">Page 259</span></a>
God's intimate relation to matter is explained. No wonder the forces
respond to his will; no wonder pantheism&mdash;the idea that matter
is God&mdash;has had such a hold upon the minds of men. Matter,
derived from him, bears marks of its parentage, is sustained by
him, and when the Divine will shall draw it nearer to himself the
new power and capabilities of a new creation shall appear. Let us
pay a higher respect to the attractions and affinities; to the
plan and power of growth; to the wisdom of the ant; the geometry of
the bee; the migrating instinct that rises and stretches its wings
toward a provided South&mdash;for it is all God's present wisdom
and power. Let us come to that true insight of the old prophets,
who are fittingly called seers; whose eyes pierced the veil of
matter, and saw God clothing the grass of the field, feeding the
sparrows, giving snow like wool and scattering hoar-frost like
ashes, and ever standing on the bow of our wide-sailing world,
and ever saying to all tumultuous forces, "Peace, be still." Let
us, with more reverent step, walk the leafy solitudes, and say:

What if there are some sounds that do not seem to be musically
rhythmic. I have seen where an avalanche broke from the mountain side
and buried a hapless city; have seen the face of a cliff shattered
to fragments by the weight of its superincumbent mass, or pierced
by the fingers of the frost and torn away. All these thunder down
the valley and are pulverized to sand. Is this music? No, but it
is a tuning of instruments. The rootlets seize the sand and turn
it to soil, to woody fibre, leafy verdure, blooming flowers, and
delicious fruit. This asks life to come, partake, and be made strong.
The grass gives itself to all flesh, the insect grows to feed the
bird, the bird to nourish the animal, the animal to develop the
man.

Notwithstanding the tendency of all high-class energy to deteriorate,
to find equilibrium, and so be strengthless and dead, there is,
somehow, in nature a tremendous push upward. Ask any philosopher,
and he will tell you that the tendency of all endowed forces is
to find their equilibrium and be at rest&mdash;that is, dead. He
draws a dismal picture of the time when the sun shall be burned
out, and the world float like a charnel ship through the dark,
cold voids of space&mdash;the sun a burned-out char, a dead cinder,
and the world one dismal silence, cold beyond measure, and dead
beyond consciousness. The philosopher has wailed a dirge without
<a name="page 261"><span class="page">Page 261</span></a>
hope, a requiem without grandeur, over the world's future. But
nature herself, to all ears attuned, sings p&aelig;ans, and shouts
to men that the highest energy, that of life, does not deteriorate.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Mere nature may deteriorate. The endowments of force must spend
themselves. Wound-up watches and worlds must run down. But nature
sustained by unexpendable forces must abide. Nature filled with
unexpendable forces continues in form. Nature impelled by a magnificent
push of life must ever rise.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Study her history in the past. Sulphurous realms of deadly gases
become solid worlds; surplus sunlight becomes coal, which is reserved
power; surplus carbon becomes diamonds; sediments settle until
the heavens are azure, the air pure, the water translucent. If
that is the progress of the past, why should it deteriorate in the
future?
</p>

<p class="indent">
There is a system of laws in the universe in which the higher have
mastery over the lower. Lower powers are constitutionally arranged
to be overcome; higher powers are constitutionally arranged for
mastery. At one time the water lies in even layers near the ocean's
bed, in obedience to the law or power of gravitation. At another
time it is heaved into mountain billows by the shoulders of the
wind. Again it flies aloft in the rising mists of the morning,
transfigured by a thousand rain bows by the higher powers of the
sun. Again it develops the enormous force of steam by the power of
heat. Again it divides into two light flying airs by electricity.
Again it stands upright as a heap by the power of some law in the
spirit realm, whose mode of working we are not yet large enough
<a name="page 262"><span class="page">Page 262</span></a>
to comprehend. The water is solid, liquid, gaseous on earth, and
in air according to the grade of power operating upon it.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The constant invention of man finds higher and higher powers. Once
he throttled his game, and often perished in the desperate struggle;
then he trapped it; then pierced it with the javelin; then shot it
with an arrow, or set the springy gases to hurl a rifle-ball at
it. Sometime he may point at it an electric spark, and it shall
be his. Once he wearily trudged his twenty miles a day, then he
took the horse into service and made sixty; invoked the winds,
and rode on their steady wings two hundred and forty; tamed the
steam, and made almost one thousand; and if he cannot yet send his
body, he can his mind, one thousand miles a second. It all depends
upon the grade of power he uses. Now, hear the grand truth of nature:
as the years progress the higher grades of power increase. Either
by discovery or creation, there are still higher class forces to
be made available. Once there was no air, no usable electricity.
There is no lack of those higher powers now. The higher we go the
more of them we find. Mr. Lockyer says that the past ten years have
been years of revelation concerning the sun. A man could not read
in ten years the library of books created in that time concerning
the sun. But though we have solved certain problems and mysteries,
the mysteries have increased tenfold.
</p>

<p class="indent">
We do not know that any new and higher forces have been added to
matter since man's acquaintance with it. But it would be easy to
add any number of them, or change any lower into higher. That is the
<a name="page 263"><span class="page">Page 263</span></a>
meaning of the falling granite that becomes soil, of the pulverized
lava that decks the volcano's trembling sides with flowers; that
is the meaning of the grass becoming flesh, and of all high forces
constitutionally arranged for mastery over lower. Take the ore from
the mountain. It is loose, friable, worthless in itself. Raise it
in capacity to cast-iron, wrought-iron, steel, it becomes a highway
for the commerce of nations, over the mountains and under them.
It becomes bones, muscles, body for the inspiring soul of steam.
It holds up the airy bridge over the deep chasm. It is obedient
in your hand as blade, hammer, bar, or spring. It is inspirable
by electricity, and bears human hopes, fears, and loves in its
own bosom. It has been raised from valueless ore. Change it again
to something as far above steel as that is above ore. Change all
earthly ores to highest possibility; string them to finest tissues,
and the new result may fit God's hand as tools, and thrill with
his wisdom and creative processes, a body fitted for God's spirit
as well as the steel is fitted to your hand. From this world take
opacity, gravity, darkness, bring in more mind, love, and God, and
then we will have heaven. An immanent God makes a plastic world.
</p>

<p class="indent">
When man shall have mastered the forces that now exist, the original
Creator and Sustainer will say, "Behold, I create all things new."
Nature shall be called nearer to God, be more full of his power.
To the long-wandering &aelig;neas, his divine mother sometimes
came to cheer his heart and to direct his steps. But the goddess
only showed herself divine by her departure; only when he stood
in desolation did the hero know he had
<a name="page 264"><span class="page">Page 264</span></a>
stood face to face with divine power, beauty, and love. Not so the
Christian scholars, the wanderers in Nature's bowers to-day. In
the first dawn of discovery, we see her full of beauty and strength;
in closer communion, we find her full of wisdom; to our perfect
knowledge, she reveals an indwelling God in her; to our ardent
love, she reveals an indwelling God in us.
</p>

<p class="indent">
But the evidence of the progressive refinements of habitation is no
more clear than that of progressive refinement of the inhabitant:
there must be some one to use these finer things. An empty house is
not God's ideal nor man's. The child may handle a toy, but a man
must mount a locomotive; and before there can be New Jerusalems
with golden streets, there must be men more avaricious of knowledge
than of gold, or they would dig them up; more zealous for love
than jewels, or they would unhang the pearly gates. The uplifting
refinement of the material world has been kept back until there
should appear masterful spirits able to handle the higher forces.
Doors have opened on every side to new realms of power, when men
have been able to wield them. If men lose that ability they close
again, and shut out the knowledge and light. Then ages, dark and
feeble, follow.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Some explore prophecy for the date of the grand transformation
of matter by the coming of the Son of Man, for a new creation. A
little study of nature would show that the date cannot be fixed.
A little study of Peter would show the same thing. He says, "What
manner of persons ought ye to be, in all holy conversation and
godliness, looking for and hastening the coming
<a name="page 265"><span class="page">Page 265</span></a>
of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved,
and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we,
according to his promise, look for a new heaven and a new earth."
</p>

<p class="indent">
The idea is, that the grand transformation of matter waits the
readiness of man. The kingdom waits the king. The scattered cantons
of Italy were only prostrate provinces till Victor Emanuel came,
then they were developed into united Italy. The prostrate provinces
of matter are not developed until the man is victor, able to rule
there a realm equal to ten cities here. Every good man hastens the
coming of the day of God and nature's renovation. Not only does
inference teach that there must be finer men, but fact affirms
that transformation has already taken place. Life is meant to have
power over chemical forces. It separates carbon from its compounds
and builds a tree, separates the elements and builds the body,
holds them separate until life withdraws. More life means higher
being. Certainly men can be refined and recapacitated as well as
ore. In Ovid's "Metamorphoses" he represents the lion in process of
formation from earth, hind quarters still clay, but fore quarters,
head, erect mane, and blazing eye&mdash;live lion&mdash;and pawing
to get free. We have seen winged spirits yet linked to forms of
clay, but beating the celestial air, endeavoring to be free; and
we have seen them, dowered with new sight, filled with new love,
break loose and rise to higher being.
</p>

<p class="indent">
In this grand apotheosis of man which nature teaches, progress
lias already been made. Man has already outgrown his harmony with
the environment of mere matter. He has given his hand to science, and
been lifted up above the earth into the voids of infinite space. He
<a name="page 266"><span class="page">Page 266</span></a>
has gone on and on, till thought, wearied amidst the infinities
of velocity and distance, has ceased to note them. But he is not
content; all his faculties are not filled. He feels that his future
self is in danger of not being satisfied with space, and worlds, and
all mental delights, even as his manhood fails to be satisfied with
the materiel toys of his babyhood. He asks for an Author and Maker
of things, infinitely above them. He has seen wisdom unsearchable,
power illimitable; but he asks for personal sympathy and love.
Paul expresses his feeling: every creature&mdash;not the whole
creation&mdash;groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now,
waiting for the adoption&mdash;the uplifting from orphanage to
parentage&mdash;a translation out of darkness into the kingdom of
God's dear Son. He hears that a man in Christ is a new creation: old
things pass away, all things become new. There is then a possibility
of finding the Author of nature, and the Father of man. He begins his
studies anew. Now he sees that all lines of knowledge converge as
they go out toward the infinite mystery; sees that these converging
lines are the reins of government in this world; sees the converging
lines grasped by an almighty hand; sees a loving face and form
behind; sees that these lines of knowledge and power are his personal
nerves, along which flashes his will, and every force in the universe
answers like a perfect muscle.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Then he asks if this Personality is as full of love as of power.
He is told of a tenderness too deep for tears, a love that has the
Cross for its symbol, and a dying cry for its expression: seeking
it, he is a new creation. He sees more wondrous things in the Word
than in the
<a name="page 267"><span class="page">Page 267</span></a>
world. He comes to know God with his heart, better than he knows
God's works by his mind.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Every song closes with the key-note with which it began, and the
brief cadence at the close hints the realms of sound through which
it has tried its wings. The brief cadence at the close is this:
All force runs back into mind for its source, constant support,
and uplifts into higher grades.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Mr. Grove says, "Causation is the will, creation is the act, of God."
Creation is planned and inspired for the attainment of constantly
rising results. The order is chaos, light, worlds, vegetable forms,
animal life, then man. There is no reason to pause here. This is
not perfection, not even perpetuity. Original plans are not
accomplished, nor original force exhausted. In another world, free
from sickness, sorrow, pain, and death, perfection of abode is
offered. Perfection of inhabitant is necessary; and as the creative
power is everywhere present for the various uplifts and refinements
of matter, it is everywhere present with appropriate power for
the uplifting and refinement of mind and spirit.

<p class="indent">
<i>Sun's Appearance.</i>&mdash;This was formerly supposed to be an
even, regular, dazzling brightness, except where the spots appeared.
But the sun's surface is now known to be mottled with what are
called rice grains or willow leaves. But the rice grains are as
large as the continent of America. The spaces between are called
pores. They constitute an innumerable number of small spots. This
appearance of the general surface is well portrayed in the cut
on <a href="#page 92">page 92</a>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Close Relation between Sun and Earth.</i>-Men always knew that
the earth received light from the sun. They subsequently discovered
that the earth was momentarily held by the power
<a name="page 270"><span class="page">Page 270</span></a>
of gravitation. But it is a recent discovery that the light is one
of the principal agents in chemical changes, in molecular grouping
and world-building, thus making all kinds of life possible (<a
href="#page 30">p. 30-36</a>). The close connection of the sun and
the earth will be still farther shown in the relation of sun-spots
and auroras. One of the most significant instances is related on
page 19, when the earth felt the fall of bolides upon the sun.
Members of the body no more answer to the heart than the planets
do to the sun.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Hydrogen Flames.</i>&mdash;It has been demonstrated that the
sun flames 200,000 miles high are hydrogen in a state of flaming
incandescence (<a href="#page 85">page 85</a>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Sun's Distance.</i>&mdash;The former estimate, 95,513,794 miles,
has been reduced by nearly one-thirtieth. Lockyer has stated it
as low as 89,895,000 miles, and Proctor, in "Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica," at 91,430,000 miles, but discovered errors show that
these estimates are too small. Newcomb gives 92,400,000 as within
200,000 miles of the correct distance. The data for a new determination
of this distance, obtained from the transit of Venus, December
8th, 1874, have not yet been deciphered; a fact that shows the
difficulty and laboriousness of the work. Meanwhile it begins to
be evident that observations of the transit of Venus do not afford
the best basis for the most perfect determination of the sun's
distance.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Since the earth's distance is our astronomical unit of measure, it
follows that all other distances will be changed, when expressed
in miles, by this ascertained change of the value of the standard.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Oxygen in the Sun.</i>&mdash;In 1877 Professor Draper announced
the discovery of oxygen lines in the spectrum of the sun. The discovery
was doubted, and the methods used were criticised by Lockyer and
others, but later and more delicate experiments substantiate Professor
Draper's claim to the discovery. The elements known to exist in
the sun are salt, iron, hydrogen,
<a name="page 271"><span class="page">Page 271</span></a>
magnesium, barium, copper, zinc, cromium, and nickel. Some elements
in the sun are scarcely, if at all, discoverable on the earth,
and some on the earth not yet discernible in the sun.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Substance of Stars.</i>&mdash;Aldebaran (<i>Frontispiece</i>)
shows salt, magnesium, hydrogen, calcium, iron, bismuth, tellurium,
antimony, and mercury. Some of the sun's metals do not appear.
Stars differ in their very substance, and will, no doubt, introduce
new elements to us unknown before.
</p>

<p class="indent">
The theory that all nebul&aelig; are very distant clusters of stars
is utterly disproved by the clearest proof that some of them are
only incandescent gases of one or two kinds.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Discoveries of New Bodies.</i>&mdash;Vulcan, the planet nearest
the sun (<a href="#page 138">page 138</a>). The two satellites of
Mars were discovered by Mr. Hall, U. S. Naval Observatory, August
11th, 1877 (<a href="#page 161">page 161</a>). "The outer one is
called Diemas; the inner, Phobus.
</p>

<p class="indent">
Sir William Herschel thought he discovered six satellites of Uranus.
The existence of four of them has been disproved by the researches of
men with larger telescopes. Two new ones, however, were discovered
by Mr. Lassell in 1846.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Saturn's Rings</i> are proved to be in a state of fluidity and
contraction (<a href="#page 171">page 171</a>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Meteors and Comets.</i>&mdash;The orbits of over one hundred
swarms of meteoric bodies are fixed: their relation to, and in some
cases indentity with, comets determined. Some comets are proved
to be masses of great weight and solidity (<a href="#page 133">page
133</a>).
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Aerolites.</i>-Some have a texture like our lowest strata of
rocks. There is a geology of stars and meteors as well as of the
earth. M. Meunier has just received the Lalande Medal from the
Paris Academy for his treatise showing that, so far as our present
knowledge can determine, some of these meteors once belonged to
a globe developed in true geological epochs, and which has been
separated into fragments by agencies with which we are not acquainted.

<p class="indent">
<i>The Horizontal Pendulum.</i>&mdash;This delicate instrument is
<a name="page 272"><span class="page">Page 272</span></a>
represented in Fig. 82. It consists of an upright standard, strongly
braced; a weight, <i>m</i>, suspended by the hair-spring of a watch,
B D, and held in a horizontal position by another watch-spring,
A C. The weight is deflected from side to side by the slightest
influence. The least change in the level of a base thirty-nine
inches long that could be detected by a spirit-level is 0".1 of
an arc&mdash;equal to raising one end 1/2068 of an inch. But the
pendulum detects a raising of one end 1/36000000 of an inch. To
observe the movements of the pendulum, it is kept in a dark room,
and a ray of light is directed to the mirror, <i>m</i>, and thence
reflected upon a screen. Thus the least movement may be enormously
magnified, and read and measured by the moving spot on the screen.
It has been discovered that when the sun rises it has sufficient
attraction to incline this instrument to the east; when it sets, to
incline it to the west. The same is true of the moon. When either
is exactly overhead or underfoot, of course there is no deflection.
The mean deflection caused by the moon at rising or setting is
0".0174; by the sun, 0".008. Great results are expected from this
instrument hardly known as yet: among others, whether gravitation
acts instantly or consumes time in coming from the sun. This will
be shown by the time of the change of the pendulum from east to
west when the sun reaches the zenith, and <i>vice versa</i> when
it crosses the nadir. The sun will be best studied without light,
in the quiet and darkness of some deep mine.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<a name="page 273"><span class="page">Page 273</span></a>
<i>Light of Unseen Stars.</i>&mdash;From careful examination, it
appears that three-fourths of the light on a fine starlight night
comes from stars that cannot be discerned by the naked eye. The
whole amount of star light is about one-eightieth of that of the
full moon.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Lateral Movements of Stars</i>, <a href="#page 226">page 226-28</a>.
</p>

<p class="indent">
<i>Future Discoveries</i>&mdash;<i>A Trans-Neptunian
Planet.</i>&mdash;Professor Asaph Hall says: "It is known to me that
at least two American astronomers, armed with powerful telescopes,
have been searching quite recently for a trans-Neptunian planet. These
searches have been caused by the fact that Professor Newcomb's tables
of Uranus and Neptune already begin to differ from observation.
But are we to infer from these errors of the planetary tables the
existence of a trans-Neptunian planet? It is possible that such
a planet may exist, but the probability is, I think, that the
differences are caused by errors in the theories of these planets.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* A few years ago the remark was frequently made that
the labors of astronomers on the solar system were finished, and
that henceforth they could turn their whole attention to sidereal
astronomy. But to-day we have the lunar theory in a very discouraging
condition, and the theories of Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
and Neptune all in need of revision; unless, indeed, Leverrier's
theories of the last two planets shall stand the test of observation.
But, after all, such a condition of things is only the natural
result of long and accurate series of observations, which make
evident the small inequalities in the motions, and bring to light
the errors of theory."
</p>

<p class="indent">
Future discoveries will mostly reveal the laws and conditions of
the higher and finer forces. Already Professor Loomis telegraphs
twenty miles without wire, by the electric currents between mountains.
We begin to use electricity for light, and feel after it for a
motor. Comets and Auroras show its presence between worlds, and
in the interstellar spaces. Let another Newton arise.

<p class="indent">
Detach any of the following maps, appropriate to the time of year,
hold it between you and a lantern out-of-doors, and you have an
exact miniature of the sky. Or, better, cut squares of suitable
sizes from the four sides of a box; put a map over each aperture;
provide for ventilation, and turn the box over a lamp or candle
out-of-doors. Use an opera glass to find the smaller stars, if
one is accessible.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
